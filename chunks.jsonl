Mathematics is, in large part, the search for patterns, and for the explanations as to why those patterns exist. Such patterns indeed exist all around us — in nature, in our homes and schools, and in the motion of the sun, moon, and stars. They occur in everything that we do and see, from shopping and cooking, to throwing a ball and playing games, to understanding weather patterns and using technology. The search for patterns and their explanations can be a fun and creative endeavour. It is for this reason that mathematicians think of mathematics both as an art and as a science. This year, we hope that you will get a chance to see the creativity and artistry involved in discovering and understanding mathematical patterns. It is important to keep in mind that mathematics aims to not just find out what patterns exist, but also the explanations for why they exist. Such explanations can often then be used in applications well beyond the context in which they were discovered, which can then help to propel humanity forward. Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 2 For example, the understanding of patterns in the motion of stars, planets, and their satellites led humankind to develop the theory of gravitation, allowing us to launch our own satellites and send rockets to the Moon and to Mars; similarly, understanding patterns in genomes has helped in diagnosing and curing diseases — among thousands of other such examples.

The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in whole numbers is called number theory.

These shapes may be in one, two, or three dimensions (1D, 2D, or 3D) — or in even more dimensions. The branch of Mathematics that studies patterns in shapes is called geometry.

After each sequence, describe in your own words what is the rule or pattern for forming the shapes in the sequence. 1.6 Relation to Number Sequences Often, shape sequences are related to number sequences in surprising ways. Such relationships can be helpful in studying and understanding both the shape sequence and the related number sequence. Example: The number of sides in the shape sequence of Regular Polygons is given by the counting numbers starting at 3, i.e., 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, .... That is why these shapes are called, respectively, regular triangle, quadrilateral (i.e., square), pentagon, hexagon, heptagon, octagon, nonagon, decagon, etc., respectively. The word ‘regular’ refers to the fact that these shapes have equal-length sides and also equal ‘angles’ (i.e., the sides look the same and the corners also look the same). We will discuss angles in more depth in the next chapter. The other shape sequences in Table 3 also have beautiful relationships with number sequences. Figure it Out 1.

To get from one shape to the next shape in the Koch Snowflake sequence, one replaces each line segment­ ‘—’ by a ‘speed bump’ . As one does this more and more times, the changes become tinier and tinier with very very small line segments. How many total line segments are there in each shape of the Koch Snowflake?

In this case, we name the angle as Angle DBE or Angle EBD. The word angle can be replaced by the symbol ‘∠’, i.e., ∠DBE or ∠EBD. Note that in specifying the angle, the vertex is always written as the middle letter. To indicate an angle, we use a small curve at the vertex (refer to Fig. 2.9). Vidya has just opened her book.

The angle measure of each of these unit parts is 1 degree, which is written as 1°. This unit part is used to assign measure to any angle: the measure of an angle is the number of 1° unit parts it contains inside it.

The division of a circle into Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 34 360 parts goes back to ancient times. The Rigveda, one of the very oldest texts of humanity going back thousands of years, speaks of a wheel with 360 spokes (Verse 1.164.48). Many ancient calendars, also going back over 3000 years—such as calendars of India, Persia, Babylonia and Egypt—were based on having 360 days in a year. In addition, Babylonian mathematicians frequently used divisions of 60 and 360 due to their use of sexagesimal numbers and counting by 60s. Perhaps the most important and practical answer for why mathematicians over the years have liked and continued to use 360 degrees is that 360 is the smallest number that can be evenly divided by all numbers up to 10, aside from 7. Thus, one can break up the circle into 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9 or 10 equal parts, and still have a whole number of degrees in each part! Note that 360 is also evenly divisible by 12, the number of months in a year, and by 24, the number of hours in a day. These facts all make the number 360 very useful.

Reprint 2025-26 Number Play 69 The rule is: one starts with any number; if the number is even, take half of it; if the number is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1; repeat. Notice that all four sequences above eventually reached the number 1. In 1937, the German mathematician, Lothar Collatz conjectured that the sequence will always reach 1, regardless of the whole number you start with. Even today — despite many mathematicians working on it — it remains an unsolved problem as to whether Collatz’s conjecture is true! Collatz’s conjecture is one of the most famous unsolved problems in mathematics. Make some more Collatz sequences like those above, starting with your favourite whole numbers. Do you always reach 1? Do you believe the conjecture of Collatz that all such sequences will eventually reach 1? Why or why not? 3.11 Simple Estimation At times, we may not know or need an exact count of things and an estimate is sufficient for the purpose at hand. For example, your school headmaster might know the exact number of students enrolled in your school, but you may only know an estimated count. How many students are in your school? About 150? 400? A thousand? Paromita’s class section has 32 children. The other 2 sections of her class have 29 and 35 children. So, she estimated the number of children in her class to be about 100. Along with Class 6, her school also has Classes 7–10 and each class has 3 sections each. She assumed a similar number in"}

If you ask your classmates about their favourite colours, you will get a list of colours. This list is an example of data. Similarly, if you measure the weight of each student in your class, you would get a collection of measures of weight—again data. Any collection of facts, numbers, measures, observations or other descriptions of things that convey information about those things is called data. We live in an age of information. We constantly see large amounts of data presented to us in new and interesting ways. In this chapter, we will explore some of the ways that data is presented, and how we can use some of those ways to correctly display, interpret and make inferences from such data! 4.1 Collecting and Organising Data Navya and Naresh are discussing their favourite games.

A pictograph represents data through pictures of objects. It helps answer questions about data with just a quick glance. In the above pictograph, one unit or symbol ( ) is used to represent one student. There are also other pictographs where one unit or symbol stands for many people or objects. Example: Nand Kishor collected responses from the children of his middle school in Berasia regarding how often they slept at least 9 hours during the night. He prepared a pictograph from the data: Response Number of Children ( = 10 Children) Always Sometimes Never Answer the following questions using the pictograph: 1. \u0007What is the number of children who always slept at least 9 hours at night? 2. \u0007How many children sometimes slept at least 9 hours at night? 3. How many children always slept less than 9 hours each night? Explain how you got your answer. Solutions 1. \u0007In the table, there are 5 pictures for ‘Always’. Each picture represents 10 children. Therefore, 5 pictures indicate 5 × 10 = 50 children. 2. There are 2 complete pictures (2 × 10 = 20) and a half picture (half of 10 = 5).

Let us look at an example of vehicular traffic at a busy road crossing in Delhi, which was studied by the traffic police on a particular day.

One unit of length stands for 100 vehicles. 100 600 200 700 300 800 400 900 1100 500 1000 1200 Time intervals Number of vehicles 11–12 10–11 9–10 8–9 7–8 6–7 We can see that the maximum traffic at the crossing is shown by the longest bar, i.e., for the time interval 7–8 a.m. The bar graph shows that 1200 vehicles passed through the crossing at that time. The second longest bar is for 8–9 a.m. During that time, 1000 vehicles passed through the crossing. Similarly, the minimum traffic is shown by the smallest bar, i.e., the bar for the time interval 6–7 a.m. During that time, only about 150 vehicles passed through the crossing. The second smallest bar is that for the time interval 11 a.m.–12 noon, when about 600 vehicles passed through the crossing.

We must choose a scale. That means we must decide how many students will be represented by a unit length of a bar so that it fits nicely on our paper. Here, we will take 1 unit length to represent 1 student. 3. For jalebi, we therefore need to draw a bar having a height of 6 units (which is the frequency of the sweet jalebi), and similarly for the other sweets we have to draw bars as high as their frequencies.

Using a scale of 1 unit length = l run would mean that we have to go all the way from 0 to 100 runs in steps of l. This would be unnecessarily tedious.

It is also desirable to make the data presentation visually appealing and easy-to-understand, so that the intended audience appreciates the information being conveyed. Let us consider an example. Here is a table naming the tallest mountain on each continent, along with the height of each mountain in meters.

Are Mount Denali and Mount Kilimanjaro very different in height? This is not so easy to quickly discern from a large table of numbers. As we have seen earlier, we can convert the table of numbers into a bar graph, as shown on the right. Here, each value is drawn as a horizontal box. These are longer or shorter depending on the number they represent. This makes it easier to compare the heights of all these mountains at a glance.

The aim of infographics is to make use of attention-attracting and engaging visuals to communicate information even more clearly and quickly, in a visually pleasing way. As an example of how infographics can be used to communicate data even more suggestively, let us go back to the table above listing the tallest mountain on each continent. We drew a bar graph with vertical bars (columns) rather than horizontal bars, to be more indicative of mountains. But instead of rectangles, we could use triangles, which look a bit more like mountains. And, we can add a splash of colour as well. Here is the result.

The goal of our bar graph earlier was to represent the heights of various mountains — using bars of the appropriate heights but the same widths. The purpose of using the same widths was to make it clear that we are only comparing heights. However, in this infographic, the taller triangles are also wider! Are taller mountains always wider?

While preparing visually-appealing presentations of data, we also need to be careful that the pictures we draw do not mislead us about the facts. In general, it is important to be careful when making or reading infographics, so that we do not mislead our intended audiences and we, ourselves, are not misled.

Choosing the appropriate scale for a pictograph or bar graph is important to accurately and effectively convey the desired information or data and to also make it visually appealing. Other aspects of a graph also contribute to its effectiveness and visual appeal such as how colours are used, what accompanying pictures are drawn, and whether the bars are horizontal or vertical. These aspects correspond to the artistic and aesthetic side of data handling and presentation. However, making visual representations of data ‘fancy’ can also sometimes be misleading. By reading pictographs and bar graphs accurately, we can quickly understand and make inferences about the data presented.

The number 7 can be arranged in only one way, as it has only two factors — 1 and 7. Numbers that have only two factors are called prime numbers or primes.

We see that 7 is a factor of both numbers, so, they are not co-prime. Clearly Guna is right, as 7 is a common factor. But where did Anshu go wrong? Writing 56 = 14 × 4 tells us that 14 and 4 are both factors of 56, but it does not tell all the factors of 56. The same holds for the factors of 63. Try another example: 80 and 63.

It is composite, as we saw that it can be written as 56 = 4 × 14 . So, both 4 and 14 are factors of 56. Now take one of these, say 14. It is also composite and can be written as 14 = 2 × 7. Therefore, 56 = 4 × 2 × 7. Now, 4 is composite and can be written as 4 = 2 × 2. Therefore, 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7. All the factors appearing here, 2 and 7, are prime numbers. So, we cannot divide them further. In conclusion, we have written 56 as a product of prime numbers. This is called prime factorisation of 56. The individual factors are called prime factors. For example, the prime factors of 56 are 2 and 7. Every number greater than 1 has a prime factorisation. The idea is the same: keep breaking the composite numbers into factors till only primes are left. The number 1 does not have any prime factorisation. It is not divisible by any prime number.

We can use the prime factorisation of both numbers — 56 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 7 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7 Now, we see that 7 is a prime factor of 56 as well as 63. Therefore, 56 and 63 are not co-prime. What about 80 and 63? Their prime factorisations are as follows: 80 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 63 = 3 × 3 × 7 There are no common prime factors. Can we conclude that they are co-prime? Suppose they have a common factor that is composite. Would the prime factors of this composite common factor appear in the prime factorisation of 80 and 63? Reprint 2025-26 Prime Time 121 Therefore, we can say that if there are no common prime factors, then the two numbers are co-prime. Let us see some examples. Example: \u0007Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11 We see that"}

Example: \u0007Consider 40 and 231. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 40 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 and 231 = 3 × 7 × 11 We see that there are no common primes that divide both 40 and 231. Indeed, the prime factors of 40 are 2 and 5 while, the prime factors of 231 are 3, 7, and 11. Therefore, 40 and 231 are co-prime! Example: \u0007Consider 242 and 195. Their prime factorisations are as follows: 242 = 2 × 11 × 11 and 195 = 3 × 5 × 13 The prime factors of 242 are 2 and 11. The prime factors of 195 are 3, 5, and 13. There are no common prime factors. Therefore, 242 and 195 are co-prime. Using prime factorisation to check if one number is divisible by another We can say that if one number is divisible by another, the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. We say that 48 is divisible by 12 because when we divide 48 by 12, the remainder is zero. How can we check if one number is divisible by another without carrying out long division? Example: Is 168 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both: 168 = 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 Since we can multiply in any order, now it is clear that, 168 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 2 × 7 = 12 × 14 Therefore, 168 is divisible by 12.

Find the prime factorisations of both: 75 = 3 × 5 × 5 and 21 = 3 × 7 Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 122 As we saw in the discussion above, if 75 was a multiple of 21, then all prime factors of 21 would also be prime factors of 75. However, 7 is a prime factor of 21 but not a prime factor of 75. Therefore, 75 is not divisible by 21. Example: Is 42 divisible by 12? Find the prime factorisations of both: 42 = 2 × 3 × 7 and 12 = 2 × 2 × 3 All prime factors of 12 are also prime factors of 42. But the prime factorisation of 12 is not included in the prime factorisation of 42. This is because 2 occurs twice in the prime factorisation of 12 but only once in the prime factorisation of 42. This means that 42 is not divisible by 12. We can say that if one number is divisible by another, then the prime factorisation of the second number is included in the prime factorisation of the first number. Figure it Out 1.

For example, 4 is a factor of 12 because 12 is divisible by 4 (12 ÷ 4 = 3). Prime numbers are numbers like 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, … that have only two factors, namely 1 and themselves. Composite numbers are numbers like 4, 6, 8, 9, … that have more than 2 factors, i.e., at least one factor other than 1 and themselves. For example, 8 has the factor 4 and 9 has the factor 3, so 8 and 9 are both composite. Every number greater than 1 can be written as a product of prime numbers. This is called the number’s prime factorisation. For example, 84 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 7. There is only one way to factorise a number into primes, except for the ordering of the factors. Two numbers that do not have a common factor other than 1 are said to be co-prime. To check if two numbers are co-prime, we can first find their prime factorisations and check if there is a common prime factor.

Perimeter of a rectangle = 2 × (length + breadth). \u0007The perimeter of a rectangle is twice the sum of its length and breadth. Perimeter of a square Debojeet wants to put coloured tape all around a square photo frame of side 1m as shown. What will be the length of the coloured tape he requires?

Thus, the length of the tape required = perimeter of the square = sum of the lengths of all four sides of the square = 1 m + 1 m + 1 m + 1 m = 4 m. Now, we know that all four sides of a square are equal in length. Therefore, in place of adding the lengths of each side, we can simply multiply the length of one side by 4. \u0007Thus, the length of the tape required = 4 × 1 m = 4 m.

A square carpet of sides 3 m is laid on the floor. Find the area of the floor that is not carpeted. Solution Length of the floor = 5 m. Width of the floor = 4 m. Area of the floor = length × width = 5 m × 4 m = 20 sq m. Length of the square carpet = 3 m. Area of the carpet = length × length = 3 m × 3 m = 9 sq m. Hence, the area of the floor laid with carpet is 9 sq m.

Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 138 Solution Length of the land (l) = 12 m. Width of land (w) = 10 m. Area of the whole land = l × w = 12 m × 10 m = 120 sq m. The sidelength of each of the four square flower beds is (s) = 4 m. Area of one flower bed = s × s = 4 m × 4 m = 16 sq m. Hence, the area of the four flower beds = 4 × 16 sq m = 64 sq m.

The area of the square is always three times as large as the areas of both rectangles added together. Ans. Only C is true. Recall that when some whole number of things are shared equally among some number of people, fractions tell us how much each share is. Shabnam: \u0007Do you remember, if one roti is divided equally between two children, how much roti will each child get? Mukta: Each child will get half a roti. Shabnam: \u0007The fraction ‘one half’ is written as 1 2 . We also sometimes read this as ‘one upon two.’ Mukta: \u0007If one roti is equally shared among 4 children, how much roti will one child get? Shabnam: Each child’s share is 1 4 roti. Mukta: And which is more 1 2 roti or 1 4 roti? Shabnam: When 2 children share 1 roti equally, each child gets 1 2 roti. When 4 children share 1 roti equally, each child gets 1 4 roti. Since, in the second group more children share the Fractions 7 Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 152 same one roti, each child gets a smaller share. So, 1 2 roti is more than 1 4 roti. 7.1 Fractional Units and Equal Shares Beni: Which fraction is greater — 1 5 or 1 9? Arvin: 9 is bigger than 5. So I would guess that 1 9 is greater than 1 5. Am I right? Beni: No! That is a common mistake. Think of these fractions as shares. Arvin: If one roti is shared among 5 children, each one gets a share of 1 5 roti.

Any fraction can be expressed in lowest terms by finding an equivalent fraction whose numerator and denominator are as small as possible. Let’s see how to express fractions in lowest terms. Example: Is the fraction 16 20 in lowest terms? No, 4 is a common factor of 16 and 20. Let us reduce 16 20 to lowest terms. We know that both 16 (numerator) and 20 (denominator) are divisible by 4. So, 16 ÷ 4 20 ÷ 4 = 4 5. Now, there is no common factor between 4 and 5. Hence, 16 20 expressed in lowest terms is 4 5. So, 4 5 is called the simplest form of 16 20, since 4 and 5 have no common factor other than 1.

Both the numerator and denominator are even again, so we can divide them each by 2 again; we get 18 30 = 9 15. We now notice that 9 and 15 are both multiples of 3, so we divide both by 3 to get 9 15 = 3 5 . Now, 3 and 5 have no common factor other"}

It was also called bhaga or ansha meaning ‘part’ or ‘piece’. The way we write fractions today, globally, originated in India. In ancient Indian mathematical texts, such as the Bakshali manuscript (from around the year 300 CE), when they wanted to write 1 2, they wrote it as 1 2 which is indeed very similar to the way we write it today! This method of writing and working with fractions continued to be used in India for the next several centuries, including by Aryabhata (499 CE), Brahmagupta (628 CE), Sridharacharya (c. 750 CE), and Mahaviracharya (c. 850 CE), among others. The line segment between the numerator and denominator in ‘1 2’ and in other Reprint 2025-26 Fractions 183 fractions was later introduced by the Moroccan mathematician Al-Hassar (in the 12th century). Over the next few centuries the notation then spread to Europe and around the world.

Fractions had also been used in other cultures such as the ancient Egyptian and Babylonian civilisations, but they primarily used only fractional units, that is, fractions with a 1 in the numerator. More general fractions were expressed as sums of fractional units, now called ‘Egyptian fractions’. Writing numbers as the sum of fractional units, e.g., 19 24 = 1 2 + 1 6 + 1 8, can be quite an art and leads to beautiful puzzles. We will consider one such puzzle below. General fractions (where the numerator is not necessarily 1) were first introduced in India, along with their rules of arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division of fractions. The ancient Indian treatises called the ‘Sulba- sutras’ shows that even during Vedic times, Indians had discovered the rules for operations with fractions. General rules and procedures for working with and computing with fractions were first codified formally and in a modern form by Brahmagupta. Brahmagupta’s methods for working with and computing with fractions are still what we use today. For example, Brahmagupta described how to add and subtract fractions as follows: “By the multiplication of the numerator and the denominator of each of the fractions by the other denominators, the fractions are reduced to a common denominator. Then, in case of addition, the numerators (obtained after the above reduction) are added. In case of subtraction, their difference is taken.’’ (Brahmagupta, Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.2, 628 CE) The Indian concepts and methods involving fractions were transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few centuries and they came into general use in Europe in around the 17th century and then spread worldwide.

The points A, B, C and D are the corners of the rectangle. Lines AB, BC, CD and DA are its sides. Its angles are ∠A, ∠B, ∠C and ∠D. The blue sides AB and CD are called opposite sides, as they lie opposite to each other. Likewise, AD and BC is the other pair of opposite sides.

SYMMETRY 9 Look around you — you may find many objects that catch your attention. Some such things are shown below: Butterfly Flower Pinwheel Rangoli There is something beautiful about the pictures above. The flower looks the same from many different angles. What about the butterfly? No doubt, the colours are very attractive. But what else about the butterfly appeals to you? In these pictures, it appears that some parts of the figure are repeated and these repetitions seem to occur in a definite pattern. Can you see what repeats in the beautiful rangoli figure?

What is the shape of the figure that is stuck to each side? Do you recognise it? How do these shapes move as you move along the boundary of the hexagon? What about the other pictures — what is it about those structures that appeals to you and what are the patterns in those structures that repeat? On the other hand, look at this picture of clouds. There is no such repetitive pattern. We can say that the first four figures are symmetrical and the last one is not symmetrical.

Then, take a rectangular piece of paper and check if the two parts overlap by folding it along its diagonal. What do you observe? Reflection So far we have been saying that when we fold a figure along a line of symmetry, the two parts overlap completely. We could also say that the part of the figure on one side of the line of symmetry is reflected by the line to the other side; similarly, the part of the figure on the other side of the line of symmetry is reflected to the first side!

However, if you fold it, the two halves will not exactly overlap. On the other hand, if you rotate it by 90° about the red point at the centre, the windmill looks exactly the same. We say that the windmill has rotational symmetry. When talking of rotational symmetry, there is always a fixed point about which the object is rotated. This fixed point is called the centre of rotation. Will the windmill above look exactly the same when rotated through an angle of less than 90°? No! An angle through which a figure can be rotated to look exactly the same is called an angle of rotational symmetry, or just an angle of symmetry, for short. Reprint 2025-26 Symmetry 231 For the windmill, the angles of symmetry are 90° (quarter turn), 180° (half turn), 270° (three-quarter turn) and 360° (full turn). Observe that when any figure is rotated by 360°, it comes back to its original position, so 360° is always an angle of symmetry. Thus, we see that the windmill has 4 angles of symmetry. Do you know of any other shape that has exactly four angles of symmetry? How many angles of symmetry does a square have? How much rotation does it require to get the initial square? We get back a"}

Another rotation through 180° from this position gives the original shape. This figure comes back to its original shape only after one complete rotation through 360°. So, we say that this figure does not have rotational symmetry. Rotational Symmetry of Figures with Radial Arms Consider this figure, a picture with 4 radial arms.

How many angles of symmetry does it have and what are they? Here is a figure with three radial arms. Trace and cut out a copy of this figure. By rotating the cutout over this figure determine its angles of rotation. We see that only a full turn or a rotation of 360° will bring the figure back into itself.

If these two figures must overlap, what can you tell about the angles? C B A B A C Observe that ∠A must overlap ∠B, ∠B must overlap ∠C and ∠C must overlap ∠A. So, ∠A = ∠B = ∠C. What must this angle be? We know that a full turn has 360 degrees. This is equally distributed amongst these three angles. So each angle must be 360° 3 = 120°.

For example, consider this situation: I have `10 with me and my sister has `6. Now, I can ask the question: ʻHow much more money should my sister get in order to have the same amount as me?ʼ We can write this in two ways: 6 + ? = 10 Or 10 – 6 = ? Here, we see the connection between ‘finding the missing number to be added’ and subtraction. For subtraction of positive and negative numbers, we will use this meaning of subtraction as ‘making equal’ or ‘finding the missing number to be added’. \u0007Evaluate 15 – 5, 100 – 10 and 74 – 34 from this perspective. In general, when there are two unequal quantities, subtraction can indicate the change needed to make the quantities equal. Subtraction shows how much the starting quantity should change in order to become the target quantity. In the context of different floor levels, what is the change required to reach the Target Floor from the Starting Floor? Notice that the change needed may be positive (for an increase) or negative (for a decrease). Teacher’s Note Your starting floor is the Art Centre and your target floor is the Sports Centre.

We can use this imagination to add and subtract any integers we like. For example, suppose we want to carry out the subtraction + 2000 – (– 200). We can imagine a lift with 2000 levels above the ground and 200 below the ground. Recall that, Target Level – Starting Level = Movement needed To go from the Starting Floor – 200 to the Target Floor + 2000, we must press + 2200 (+ 200 to get to zero, and then + 2000 more after that to get to + 2200).

Other numbers are not marked. It can be convenient to use this unmarked number line to add and subtract integers. You can show, or simply imagine, the scale of the number line and the positions of numbers on it. For example, this unmarked number line (UNL) shows the addition problem: 85 + (– 60) = ? +85 +25 – 60 0 We then can visualise that 85 + (– 60) = 25 The following UNL shows a subtraction problem which can"}

After one hour, he checks his pocket and finds 5 positive and 3 negative tokens. On which floor is he now? He must have pressed ‘+’ five times and ‘–’ 3 times and (+ 5)+(– 3)= + 2. So, he is at Floor + 2 now. Here is another way to do the calculation. A positive token and a negative token cancel each other, because the value of this pair of tokens together is zero. These two tokens in his pocket meant that he pressed ‘+’ once and ‘–’ once, respectively, and these cancel each other. We say that a positive and a negative token make a ʻzero pairʼ. When you remove all the zero pairs, you are left with two positive tokens, so (+5) + (–3) = +2. We can perform any such addition using tokens! Example: Add + 5 and – 8.

The explicit use of negative numbers in the context of accounting is seen in a number of ancient Indian works, including in the Bakśhālī manuscript from around the year 300 CE, where a negative number was written using a special symbol placed after the number (rather than before the number as we do today). The first general treatment of positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero — all on an equal footing as equally-valid numbers on which one can perform the basic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and even division — was given by Brahmagupta in his Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta in the year 628 CE. Brahmagupta gave clear and explicit rules for operations on all numbers — positive, negative, and zero — that essentially formed the modern way of understanding these numbers that we still use today! Some of Brahmagupta’s key rules for addition and subtraction of positive numbers, negative numbers and zero are given below: Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 18.30, 628 CE) 1. The sum of two positives is positive (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). 2. The sum of two negatives is negative. To add two negatives, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (e.g., (– 2) + (– 3) = – 5). 3. To add a positive number and a negative number, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2, 2 + (– 3) = – 1 and – 3 + 5 = 2). 4. The sum of a number and its"}

The sum of a number and its inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). 5. The sum of any number and zero is the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2 and 0 + 0 = 0). Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 268 Brahmagupta’s Rules for Subtraction (Brāhma-sphuṭa-siddhānta 18.31-18.32) 1. If a smaller positive is subtracted from a larger positive, the result is positive (e.g., 3 – 2 = 1). 2. If a larger positive is subtracted from a smaller positive, the result is negative (e.g., 2– 3 = – 1). 3. Subtracting a negative number is the same as adding the corresponding positive number (e.g., 2 – (– 3) = 2 + 3). 4. Subtracting a number from itself gives zero (e.g., 2 – 2 = 0 and – 2 – (– 2) = 0). 5. Subtracting zero from a number gives the same number (e.g., – 2 – 0 = – 2 and 0 – 0 = 0). Subtracting a number from zero gives the number’s inverse (e.g., 0 – (– 2) = 2). Once you understand Brahmagupta’s rules, you can do addition and subtraction with any numbers whatsoever — positive, negative, and zero! \u0007Figure it Out 1.

Can you explain each of Brahmagupta’s rules in terms of Bela’s Building of Fun, or in terms of a number line? 2. Give your own examples of each rule. Brahmagupta was the first to describe zero as a number on an equal footing with positive numbers as well as with negative numbers, and the first to give explicit rules for performing arithmetic operations on all such numbers, positive, negative, and zero—forming what is now called a ring. It would change the way the world does mathematics. However, it took many centuries for the rest of the world to adopt zero and negative numbers as numbers. These numbers were transmitted to, accepted by, and further studied by the Arab world by the 9th century, before making their way to Europe by the 13th century. Reprint 2025-26 The Other Side of Zero 269 Surprisingly, negative numbers were still not accepted by many European mathematicians even in the 18th century. Lazare Carnot, a French mathematician in the 18th century, called negative numbers ‘absurd’. But over time, zero as well as negative numbers proved to be indispensable in global mathematics and science, and are now considered to be critical numbers on an equal footing with and as important as positive numbers — just as Brahmagupta had recommended and explicitly described way back in the year 628 CE! This abstraction of arithmetic rules on all numbers paved the way for the modern development of algebra, which we will learn about in future classes.

The numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, ... are called positive integers and the numbers …, – 4, – 3, – 2, – 1 are called negative integers. Zero (0) is neither positive nor negative. Every given number has another number associated to it which when added to the given number gives zero. This is called the additive inverse of the number. For example, the additive inverse of 7 is – 7 and the additive inverse of – 543 is 543. Addition can be interpreted as Starting Position + Movement = Target Position. Addition can also be interpreted as the combination of movements or increases/decreases: Movement 1 + Movement 2 = Total Movement. Subtraction can be interpreted as Target Position – Starting Position = Movement. Reprint 2025-26 Ganita Prakash | Grade 6 270 In general, we can add two numbers by following Brahmagupta’s Rules for Addition: a. If both numbers are positive, add the numbers and the result is a positive number (e.g., 2 + 3 = 5). b. If both numbers are negative, add the numbers (without the signs), and then place a minus sign to obtain the result (– 2 + (– 3) = – 5). c. If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., – 5"}

If one number is positive and the other is negative, subtract the smaller number (without the sign) from the greater number (without the sign), and place the sign of the greater number to obtain the result (e.g., – 5 + 3 = – 2). d. A number plus its additive inverse is zero (e.g., 2 + (– 2) = 0). e. A number plus zero gives back the same number (e.g., – 2 + 0 = – 2). We can subtract two integers by converting the problem into an addition problem and then following the rules of addition. Subtraction of an integer is the same as the addition of its additive inverse. Integers can be compared: … – 3 < – 2 < – 1 < 0 < +1 < +2 < +3 < ... Smaller numbers are to the left of larger numbers on the number line. We can give meaning to positive and negative numbers by interpreting them as credits and debits. We can also interpret positive numbers as distances above a reference point like the ground level. Similarly, negative numbers can be interpreted as distances below the ground level. When measuring temperatures in degrees Celsius, positive temperatures are those above the freezing point of water, and negative temperatures are those below the freezing point of water.

The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. Having nurtured the students’ inherent abilities touching upon all the five planes of human existence, the pañchakośhas, in the Foundational and the Preparatory Stages have paved the way for the progression of their learning further at the Middle Stage. Thus, the Middle Stage acts as a bridge between the Preparatory and the Secondary Stages, spanning three years from Grades 6 to 8.

This framework, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made Reprint 2025-26 iv all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, is one of these. It has been developed in consonance with the recommendations of NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023 to take students on a journey of experiential learning by citing examples from the world of the learners.

The content stimulates curiosity, a sense of exploration, questioning, and critical thinking. The content seamlessly weaves together concepts from physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, along with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The textbook aims to engage learners through an integrated approach by including multiple activities and thoughtful use of technology. The textbook offers ample opportunities for reflection and group discussions. To encourage creativity and innovation, it is feasible to regard students as active participants in the learning process, rather than mere recipients of a predetermined set of knowledge. This can only be achieved if the necessary number of hours are dedicated to science teaching–learning annually as outlined in NCF-SE 2023. The pedagogical approach of the textbook also considers how important it is for students to think critically, reason well and make decisions. It also provides students with numerous opportunities to learn from each other, making the learning experience more engaging for both teachers and students. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

New Delhi 30 June 2024 Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director National Council of Educational Research and Training Reprint 2025-26 About the Book Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6 learners has been crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The policy advocates a radical shift from a content-based education to a competency-based education, particularly in the realm of science. Therefore, the formulation of curricular goals for Science, subsequent competencies and learning outcomes are tailored towards competency-based learning. These curricular goals encompass various scientific concepts, including matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the exploration of the interface between science, society and technology. Additionally, the goals focus on the nature of science, its processes, historical and contemporary aspects of the development of science and science communication. While these goals are explicitly articulated, they are interdependent and collectively contribute to a better understanding of the world around us. Accordingly, the chapters of this textbook are structured around creative activities, reflective questions, processes and illustrations. The integration of the concepts from biology, chemistry, physics and earth science, and cross-cutting themes, such as value education, inclusive education, Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS) and environmental education have been interwoven in the content. Thus, the textbook aims to provide experience-based learning, rather than simply reading and memorising the concepts. In the Middle Stage, science teaching–learning adopts an integrated approach. This integrated approach develops fundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and earth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners to appreciate the interrelations between subjects"}

In the Middle Stage, science teaching–learning adopts an integrated approach. This integrated approach develops fundamental capacities across biology, chemistry, physics and earth science. The use of an integrated approach helps the learners to appreciate the interrelations between subjects and make sense of their observations and experiences. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 6, comprises twelve chapters. As the name of the textbook suggests, there are numerous opportunities for the learners to explore the world of science and its nature. Through the chapters, learners will embark on a journey that will connect them to the world around and spark curiosity for further exploration. The hands-on activities embedded within each chapter engages the learners and provide them an opportunity to Reprint 2025-26 vi reflect on learning. These activities are inclusive in nature. Some activities require both the teacher and learners to prepare in advance. Chapter 1, titled ‘The Wonderful World of Science’, provides a holistic view of the new topic of Science introduced in the Middle Stage. It showcases, through examples, the essence of Science—a way of thinking, observing, and finding out by doing, and by asking questions. This chapter weaves together the concepts covered in the rest of the book, and aims to excite the readers as they start their adventures into the world of science. There are no assessment exercises in this chapter and is designed to be non-evaluative. Also, every chapter in the book begins with an introduction that makes the learners curious and tries to show different ways with which the goals of the curriculum can be achieved effectively.

The chapters begin with the stories related to real-life situations, these are meant to capture learners’ interest and connect them with what is already known. The various activities given are based on scientific processes, designed to provide hands and minds-on experiences. Following each activity, there are questions to help learners understand and assess how well they have grasped the information. Questions are significant in the learning process. They help learners to explore and reinforce their understanding. One will also find many thought-provoking questions designed to encourage deep thinking, self-awareness and critical analysis. These questions prompt learners to ponder and delve deeper into their thoughts. In order to sustain the interest of the readers, some of the challenging ideas, additional information, poems, stories, strange facts and other interesting materials are also presented as add on non-evaluative content in the boxes labelled ‘Do you know?’, ‘More to know!’, ‘Think it over!’ and ‘More to do!’. The thrill of scientific inquiry comes from pursuing the unknown, giving learners the opportunity to think and explore beyond the syllabus. Some chapters also include a section called ‘Know a scientist’, which presents the contributions of Indian scientists related to that concept. All these box items, including brief biographies of scientists, are non-evaluative. The important ideas and steps in understanding a given concept of science are included as ‘Keywords’ at the end of each chapter. These ‘Keywords’ will help learners to acknowledge various Reprint 2025-26 vii ideas and encourage them to think more deeply about the content.

These words guide learners on how scientific knowledge is generated, tested and applied. ‘Summary’ offers an overview of the chapter’s main points, reinforcing the key ideas discussed. It serves to outline the content presented in the chapter. A non-evaluative interesting element that has been incorporated in some of the chapters is the introduction of certain verses from various Indian texts to promote rootedness in the learners as envisaged in NEP 2020. The primary aim of Curiosity is to prepare the children for becoming the responsible members of the society, and therefore efforts have been made to raise awareness about various issues, such as gender, region, environment, health and hygiene, water scarcity and energy conservation. Activities given in the book endeavour to promote peer-learning and group activities. The assessment exercises, ‘Let us enhance our learning’, play a vital role in the learning process. They help to reinforce the understanding and identify areas for improvement, making them essential components of effective teaching and learning. Assessment consists of various exercises, from pictorial questions to creating puzzles and multiple-choice questions, to create a challenging and interesting experience for the learners. These questions also facilitate the evaluation of various competencies expected to be developed through a particular chapter. Peer and group activities to explore answers to the questions are also encouraged. A significant feature of the book is what we termed as ‘Learning further’.

In this section, some projects and activities are designed to increase learners’ interaction with experts, teachers, parents and the wider community. Learners are encouraged to gather diverse information and draw their own conclusions. The textbook is just one way to learn. Learners should enhance their knowledge by exploring and observing their surroundings. Information and Communication Technology (ICT) can also be a valuable tool for learners’ learning and development, when used appropriately. Learners can explore ICT with the help of Quick Response (QR) codes provided in the textbook. QR codes make the reading experiences more interactive and enjoyable. These QR Reprint 2025-26 viii codes that have additional resources can be accessed by the learners at their own convenience and pace. These additional resources include videos, puzzles, games, quizzes, audio, documentaries and additional content on some topics. At the end of this book, learners will find a page titled ‘It is not the end, my friend!’. This includes words of encouragement, motivating learners to continue their educational journey and ignite their curiosity for further learning. It is meant to be non-evaluative. May the journey of every learner be filled with joy and continue the curiosity in the higher grades as well!

We start exploring our surroundings and asking questions right from our childhood. Did you enjoy discovering and exploring the world around you in the Preparatory Stage of school? As you enter the Middle Stage, we will continue this fascinating journey, trying to explore and understand the beautiful world we live in. And for that, we have a new subject, Science. Welcome to the wonderful world of Science! Science is a way of thinking, observing and doing things to understand the world we live in and to uncover the secrets of the universe. Think of it as a big adventure—we ask questions, explore the world and try to understand how things work. For this, the most important thing is to have ‘Curiosity’, which is where the title of this book comes from. Whether it is studying tiny grains of sand or massive mountains, a leaf of grass or a vast forest, there is always something new and exciting to discover. Have you ever looked up at the night sky and wondered why the stars shine? Or watched a flower bloom and wondered how it knows when to open? These are just a few of the many mysteries that science helps us unravel. The most wonderful thing about science is that it is everywhere. From the depths of the ocean to the What is Science? ?

Sometimes, we find that a piece of this puzzle has been put in the wrong place and needs to be moved. New discoveries often change our understanding of the world. As you go through this book, you will encounter interesting ideas, do some thought-provoking experiments, and see how some of what we will find out is useful in our vastness of outer space, from what is cooking in the kitchen to what is happening on the playground, some of the most groundbreaking discoveries have often come from unexpected places.

Across the country, we have different cuisines with their many tasty dishes. What are they made of? How do we find out? Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 4 Then again, there are so many different things around us—the paper we write on, the metal key, the plastic ruler and the rubber eraser in our box, the magnet that keeps the box closed, the clothes we wear, the cup we drink milk in and so many other things. What are they made of? Are they made of different materials? How do we separate different materials from one another? Along with food, we need water to survive. Water is such a delightful substance. Have you ever jumped in a puddle when it rained? Do you ever wonder why and how it rains? Have you noticed that water freezes and becomes ice when we cool it and boils and becomes steam when we heat it?

But why limit our questions to the Earth alone? We can ask questions on things beyond—the Sun, the Moon, and the millions of stars that shine in the sky! Whether you are learning about the structure of a leaf, discovering how things move, or separating the skin of a peanut seed, we hope each chapter of this book will ignite your spirit of inquiry. And hopefully you will have lots of questions on your mind! Even though you may have not realised, you have already been fi nding answers to many of your questions. Suppose your pen stops writing. What would you do? You would ask yourself the question, “Why did my pen stop writing?” You might guess that the ink fi nished. You would then test this guess by opening the pen and checking the ink refi ll. If it is empty, you would know that your guess was correct. But suppose you found that the ink was not fi nished. Now what would you do? You would make another guess—perhaps the ink might have dried up. To test if this guess is correct or not, you will try something else. This is exactly how Science works!

Though we all apply the scientific method to some extent, learning science will develop our capabilities for finding solutions to bigger problems and solving more mysteries of the universe. And to be able to learn science well, the first and foremost thing is to be curious and observe your surroundings keenly. And when we are curious, we start posing questions, asking how and why? Just remember, the world is full of things we do not know, things that are waiting to be explored.

You must have noticed that plants show variation in the features related to stems, leaves, flowers, and more. The stems of different plants vary in thickness, height, and hardness, while the leaves vary in shape, colour, size and arrangement. You might have tried grouping the plants in Activity 2.3 using one of these features. You might have also learnt in earlier classes that plants can be grouped into herbs, shrubs, and trees based on their height and types of stem. Let us study the features of plants in more detail and group them on that basis. Activity 2.4: Let us group   Let us go on a nature walk again for some more interesting observations.   Look closely at the height of different plants. Are these plants shorter than you, as tall as you, or taller than you?   Is the stem brown or green? Touch and feel the stems and try to bend them gently.

What differences do you see in the veins of leaves shown in Fig. 2.4a and Fig. 2.4b? In some leaves, you can observe a net-like pattern of veins on both sides of a thick middle vein. This pattern is called reticulate venation. For example, leaves of hibiscus exhibit reticulate venation (Fig. 2.4a). In some leaves, you may observe that the veins run parallel. This pattern is called parallel venation. For example, the leaves of banana plants and grasses exhibit parallel venation (Fig. 2.4b and Fig. 2.4c). Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science |"}

They use different body parts for moving from one place to another. They may use wings, legs, and other parts that help them to move. Here, we have identified animals based on the types of movement and the body parts used for movement. How can we group animals based on their movements? Additionally, many animals differ from each other in shape, size, structure, colour, and other features. Some of these features can also be used to group animals in various ways. Like plants, grouping of animals is important for understanding their diversity. Janaki Ammal (1897–1984) was an Indian botanist dedicated to environmental work and helped to document and preserve India’s rich plant biodiversity. She played a key role in the ‘Save Silent Valley’ movement. As the head of the Botanical Survey of India, she initiated programmes to document the plant diversity of India.

The movement was successful in saving the Silent Valley. 2.3 Plants and Animals in Different Surroundings You might have observed during nature walks that different animals live in different surroundings. You have also recorded movement of animals in Table 2.5. Does the movement of these animals depend upon their surroundings? Let us consider fishes and goat as examples. Fishes live in water. They have streamlined bodies and fins for movement in water (Fig. 2.8a). Goats live in grassy areas and move with the help of legs (Fig. 2.8b). The sizes and shapes of animals also differ from one another.

A few examples are given. You can add more. Table 2.6: Animals and plants found in different surroundings What are your observations regarding plants and animals found in various regions? Discuss your observations with your classmates. You might observe from Table 2.6 that the plants and animals found in one kind of region are different from those found in another kind of region. Fig. 2.9: Cactus with thick and fleshy stems in a desert Fig. 2.10: A deodar tree in the mountains During a discussion in the classroom, Alex recalls that he observed cactus plants with thick and fleshy stems in the deserts of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.9). Maya shares that she saw deodar trees in the Himalayas of Himachal Pradesh (Fig. 2.10). These trees are conical in shape and have flexible and sloping branches. Notice that these two types of plants found in different regions are different Reprint 2025-26 Diversity in the Living World 25 from each other. Why is it so? Why does the biodiversity of a region vary from that of another? Let us find out. There is very little water available in the deserts. A hot desert is typically very hot during the day and very cold at night. Therefore, you will find plants and animals in these areas that can tolerate and survive both the hot conditions during the day and cold conditions at night. The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have"}

The fleshy stems of plants found in the desert can store water and help them tolerate the hot conditions in these places. The mountains in extremely cold regions experience frequent snowfall. In order to survive in such conditions, some of the trees have the ability to let the snow slide off easily. Conical shape and sloping branches of deodar trees enable them to do so easily. You must have understood by now that the biodiversity varies from region to region because of diverse conditions. Look at the images of a camel from the hot desert of Rajasthan (Fig. 2.11) and a camel from the cold desert of Ladakh (Fig. 2.12). What are the differences you observe between them? What advantages do these differences provide to these camels? The camel of the hot desert has long legs with wide hooves. Alex shares that his grandmother told him that the long legs and wide hooves help these camels to walk on the sandy desert without sinking into the sand. On the other hand, the height and legs of camels of a cold desert are comparatively shorter than those found in a hot desert. These short legs allow them to walk easily in mountainous regions.

Camels found in the hot desert have one hump each that helps them to survive during the scarcity of food. Camels found in the cold desert have two humps each. These two humps shrink in late winters because there is not much food available in the cold desert and they have to use food stored in their humps during that time. Moreover, they grow long hair from head to neck, which help them survive the cold winters of Ladakh. What other features can help camels to survive in the desert? Other students also start sharing their observations. Kashi from Rajasthan says that camels excrete small amounts of urine, their dung is dry, and they do not sweat. As camels do not lose much water from their bodies, they can survive for many days without drinking water. Maya talks about seeing plants with beautiful bright flowers, rhododendrons, in the Shola forests of Nilgiris. Here, rhododendrons are of shorter height and have smaller leaves to survive through the heavy winds on mountain tops. However, Pema, who is from Sikkim, mentions that she has observed rhododendrons in the nearby mountains to be taller (Fig. 2.13). So, even plants such as rhododendrons may exhibit different features in different regions to survive the conditions of those regions. Sagar tells his classmates that he went to the Andaman and Nicobar Islands with his parents for a special event. He saw huge whales and colourful fish in the ocean. His father explained that the streamlined body of fish helps them to swim in water.

Fig. 2.13: Different features of rhododendrons Reprint 2025-26 Diversity in the Living World 27 We have learnt that the plants and animals living in a particular region have special features that make them fit to survive there. The special features that enable plants and animals to survive in a particular region are called adaptations. The shape of the deodar tree and the height of the rhododendron are adaptations that enable them to survive in the mountainous regions. The place where plants and animals live is called their habitat. For example, the habitat of sea turtles is the sea or the ocean. The habitat of a camel is the hot or the cold desert, and the habitat of a rhododendron is the mountains. The habitat of plants and animals provides them food, water, air, shelter and other needs for their survival. Many types of plants and animals may share the same habitat. Habitat plays an important role in shaping the biodiversity of a region. What are the different ways in which you can group plants and animals based on their habitats? One way is to group them into those ‘that live on land’ and those ‘that live in water’. The plants and animals that live on land are said to live in terrestrial habitats. Some examples of terrestrial habitats are forests, deserts, grasslands, and mountains. Salim Ali (1896–1987) travelled across India to observe diversity in birds. He prepared a list of birds and documented their travel routes and habitats. He recorded the regions with high diversity of birds and took measures to conserve these regions. Keoladeo National Park in Bharatpur, Rajasthan and Ranganathittu Bird Sanctuary in Mandya, Karnataka are examples of regions he preserved. He wrote a"}

Know a scientist Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 28 The plants and animals that live in water are said to live in aquatic habitats. Some examples of aquatic habitats are ponds, lakes, rivers, and oceans. Some animals, such as frogs, can live in water as well as on land. These are called amphibians. What would happen if the habitat of a plant or an animal is damaged? What would happen if a goat does not get grass to eat? Can a fish survive without water? Check with your parents, grandparents, and neighbours to know about the plants, birds, insects or any other animal they used to see frequently in their childhood but do not see as often now. These changes often happen when habitats are damaged. The damage to habitats of plants and animals results in loss of their homes, food, and other resources. This leads to the loss of biodiversity. The population of the Bengal Tiger, Cheetah, and Great Indian Bustard has declined in India due to loss of natural habitats caused by human activities. The Government of India has initiated several projects to conserve our biodiversity. ‘Project Tiger’ was initiated in 1973 to protect the declining population of the Bengal Tiger.

Medu and Mishti visit the ‘Traditional Food Festival’ organised in their school. The theme of the festival is ‘Eat Healthy, Live Healthy’. The festival features various stalls displaying different kinds of traditional dishes. Dr Poshita, a nutritional expert, explains to students that ʻHealth is the Ultimate Wealthʼ. Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 40 Let us understand what Dr Poshita means by this statement. Have you ever missed a meal? How do you feel when you miss a meal? We feel tired and less energetic when we do not eat for some time. Why do you think a marathon runner drinks glucose water during and after a race? Glucose provides instant energy. Glucose is an example of a carbohydrate. Carbohydrates are one of the primary sources of energy in our diet. Cereals like wheat, rice, and maize, vegetables like potato and sweet potato, and fruits like banana, pineapple, and mango are some sources of carbohydrates (Fig. 3.2). Do you know that common sugar is also a type of carbohydrate? Why do you think we prefer to have laddoos as a part of our traditional diet in winters?

During a voyage in 1746, Scottish physician James Lind observed that sailors who consumed lemons and oranges recovered from these symptoms. Bleeding and swollen gums are symptoms of a disease called scurvy. Case 2 In the 1960s, Indian scientists found that among the human population in the Himalayan region and the Northern plains of India, symptoms of swelling at the front of the neck were prevalent. As per norms of the Government of India, an effort was made to supplement common salt with iodine for preparing iodised salt. Consumption of iodised salt visibly reduced the above symptoms. These symptoms were due to a deficiency of iodine in the soil of this region resulting in a lack of iodine in the local food and water supply. Swelling at the front of the neck is a symptom of a disease called goitre. The right amount of protein must be included in the diet of growing children for their proper growth and development.

These food items are some sources of vitamins (Fig. 3.6) and minerals. Although vitamins and minerals are required in small amounts, they are essential to keep our body healthy. What differences do you observe in raw and cooked vegetables? Have you ever noticed that vegetables sometimes lose their bright colour, or become softer and less crisp when cooked? Some nutrients like vitamin C and others are lost during cooking due to high heat. Would it not be wise to include fruits and uncooked vegetables into our diet? Washing cut or peeled vegetables and fruits may also result in the loss of some vitamins. However, it is highly recommended that all fruits and vegetables be thoroughly washed before consumption. Fruits and vegetables are rich in dietary fibres. Let us see how dietary fibres are beneficial for us. In addition to the essential nutrients, our body needs dietary fibres and water. Dietary fibres, also known as roughage, do not provide any nutrients to our body. However, they are an essential component of our food. They help our body get rid of undigested food and ensure smooth passage of stools. Roughage in our food is provided mainly by suitable plant products. Do we obtain all nutrients from plants and animals? No, Medu. Nutrients like salt can be obtained from seawater or from rocks.

Eating food that is locally grown and plant based, to the extent possible, is not only healthy for the body but is also good for our environment and our planet. Water is also an essential part of our diet. It helps the body absorb nutrients from food. It removes waste from the body through sweat and urine. We should drink sufficient water regularly to keep ourselves healthy. My grandma has difficulty in passing stool. Now I understand why the doctor advised her to eat food that is high in fibre. Coluthur Gopalan (1918–2019) initiated nutrition research in India. He analysed more than 500 Indian foods for their nutritional value and recommended an appropriate diet in the Indian context. He led surveys on the nutritional status of the Indian population, identifying widespread deficiencies in protein, energy, and other food components. This led to the implementation of the Mid Day Meal Programme in 2002, now a ‘PM POSHAN’ initiative, to provide balanced food in the government-run and government-aided schools of our country.

Exploring Magnets The story was based on a ship carrying spices from Kerala for trade in the olden days. Reshma was aware that in those days, the sailors used stars to find directions at night. But in her story, a situation arose wherein the sailors got caught in a storm with an overcast sky and stars were not visible. Reshma could not take her story forward as she could not think of a way for sailors to find directions. She searched for information on the internet and her school library. She learnt that the travellers used a device, known as a magnetic compass, for finding directions. Reshma had seen pencil boxes and purses which had magnets to keep them closed. A writing board in her school also had a duster with a magnet. But she had never looked at those carefully. She now became curious to learn more about magnets and magnetic compasses. Reprint 2025-26 The magnets used by sailors in the olden days were based on naturally occurring magnets, known as lodestones which were discovered in ancient times.

The end of the magnet that points towards north direction is called the North-seeking pole or the North pole of the magnet. The other end that points towards the South direction is called the South-seeking pole or the South pole of the magnet. A freely suspended magnet rests along the north-south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. Repeat this activity with a small iron bar in place of the bar magnet. What do you observe? Does it always rest along north-south direction? It does not. It can rest along any direction. This implies that only magnets rest along north-south direction. This activity provides us with a way to test whether a piece of metal is a magnet or not. The property of a freely suspended magnet to always rest along the north-south direction is used to find directions. Based on this, a small device called a magnetic compass was developed in olden days for finding directions. It has a magnet in the shape of a needle which can rotate freely (Fig. 4.6). The needle of a magnetic compass indicates the north-south direction. The compass is kept at the place where we wish to know the directions. After some time, the needle comes to rest in the north-south direction. The compass box is then gently rotated until the north and south marked on the dial are aligned with the needle. Now all directions at that place are as indicated on the dial. A magnetic compass is usually a small circular box with a transparent cover on it, as shown in Fig. 4.6.

The new school year has started. Deepa needs a new uniform since she has grown taller. Her mother takes her to a cloth shop. She asks for a two-metre cloth piece. The shopkeeper measures the cloth using a metal measuring rod. Then, the tailor takes her measurements using a flexible measuring tape. Her mother instructs the tailor to increase the length of her uniform by char angula (four fingers width). Are the tape and rod similar to the scale that the elder sister has in her geometry box? What did mother mean by char angula? Deepa shares her experience with her school friends Anish, Hardeep, Padma, Tasneem and this leads to a discussion amongst them.

Hardeep says, “I have seen my grandmother measuring cloth by the length of her arm.” “Have you ever seen how a farmer measures length to divide his field into beds? He walks and counts the number of his strides,” says Padma. “Oh, not just the length of the strides—sometimes they also use the length of their feet to measure,” adds Anish. Deepa says excitedly, “Measuring length using body parts must be so much fun! Let us also measure something using a body part.” “What should we measure? Okay, let us measure the length of the table in our classroom,” says Tasneem. Padma adds, “And which body part should we use to measure it?” Deepa says, “Let us use our handspan. I will show you how to use it. I have seen my mother using it. She calls it balisht.” Hardeep adds, “Okay. Let us also note down our measurements.” Fig. 5.1: Use of handspan for measuring Deepa Padma Tasneem Anish Hardeep Reprint 2025-26 Measurement of Length and Motion 81 Padma says, “Oh, the number of handspans is different for all of us.

Deepa says thoughtfully, “No wonder people use scales and measuring tapes.” Deepa and her friends compare the length of the table with the length of their handspans. The length of the table is expressed in terms of their handspans. Here, the handspan used for measurement is an example of a unit. And the length is expressed in two parts, a number and a unit. For example, if the length of the table is found to be 13 handspans, then 13 is the number and ‘handspan’ is the unit selected for the measurement. However, handspans and other similar units, such as length of hand, foot, fist or fingers, differ from person to person. Thus, there is a need for such a unit for which measurements of the same length made by different people do not differ.

Fig. 5.2: A metre scale 5.2 Standard Units Several systems of units evolved with time in different parts of the world. However, when people started travelling from one place to another, it created a lot of confusion. This led to the different countries coming together and adopting a set of standard units of measurement. The system of units now used is known as the ‘International System of Units’ or SI units. The SI unit of length is metre. Its symbol is m. A metre scale is shown in Fig. 5.2. One metre (m) is divided into 100 equal divisions. Each division is called a centimetre (cm). You may be familiar with a smaller part of the metre scale, typically 15 cm long, shown in Fig. 5.3. Look carefully at the 15-cm scale. It has markings (in cm) from 0 to 15. The length of any section between two consecutive big marks, such as between 1 and 2 or between 5 and 6, is 1 cm. Observe that these sections Reprint 2025-26 Measurement of Length and Motion 83 Fig. 5.3: A 15-cm scale of 1 cm length are further divided into 10 equal parts. The length of one of these smaller parts is called a millimetre (mm). 1 mm is the smallest value of length that you can measure using this scale. 1 mm is equal to one-tenth of a centimeter (1 mm = 0.1 cm). For measuring larger lengths, we use a larger unit called a kilometre (km)"}

For measuring larger lengths, we use a larger unit called a kilometre (km) which is equal to 1000 metres. And for measuring smaller lengths, we use units such as centimetre or millimetre. 1 km = 1000 m 1 m = 100 cm 1 cm = 10 mm Would it be convenient to use the unit metre to measure larger lengths, such as the length of a railway track between two cities, or to measure smaller lengths, such as the thickness of a page of a book? ? In some scales, you might have noticed another scale marking. This scale marking is in inches, where 1 inch = 2.54 cm. In earlier days, units, such as inch and foot, were used to measure length. These units are still used by some people. Do you know? Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 84 5.3 Correct Way of Measuring Length For measuring any length, we need an appropriate scale. For example, if you want to measure the length of your pencil, you may use a 15-cm scale. Similarly, if the height of a room is to be measured, you may need a metre scale or a measuring tape. You cannot directly measure the girth of a tree or the size of your chest using a metre scale. For such measurements, flexible measuring tape, such as a tailor’s tape is more suitable. While measuring lengths, we need to take care of some points. What is the correct way to place the scale? Place the scale in contact with the object along its length"}

Fig. 5.4: Method of placing the scale (b) Incorrect (a) Correct What is the correct position of the eye while reading the scale? For example, if you are trying to measure the length of a pencil by aligning it with a scale, the position of your eye should be directly above the tip of the pencil (Fig. 5.5). No, but we should first learn the correct way of using a scale to measure length. Suppose we all measure the length of the table again, but this time using a metre scale. Will our results still be different? Reprint 2025-26 Measurement of Length and Motion 85 How to measure the length if the ends of the scale are broken? If the ends of the scale are broken or the zero marking is not clear, it can still be used for measurement. With such a scale, use any other full mark of the scale, say, 1.0 cm (Fig. 5.6). Then you must subtract the reading of this mark from the reading at the other end. For example, in Fig. 5.6, the reading at one end is 1.0 cm and at the other end, it is 10.4 cm. Therefore, the length of the object is 10.4 cm–1.0 cm = 9.4 cm. Fig. 5.6: Correct method of placing the scale with broken end How do visually challenged students measure lengths?

Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 86 Object Length of the object While writing the length, do not forget to write the unit also. Thus, your result will consist of two parts—one part is a number and the other part is the unit of measurement. Some of your friends in the class would have measured the length of the same objects. Compare the lengths measured by you with that of your friends. Are the measured lengths the same or slightly different? If not the same, discuss the possible reasons for the differences. Why are some length measuring devices made up of flexible materials? Units of length, such as kilometre, metre, centimetre and millimetre, begin with a lowercase letter, except at the beginning of a sentence. Their symbols km, m, cm and mm are also written in lowercase letters, and are never followed by ‘s’ for the plural. Note that a full stop is not written after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the length, always leave a space between the number and the unit.

She asks the students to reach there directly in the morning. Deepa and her friends start discussing whether the garden would be closer than their school or farther. Tasneem and Padma say that the garden would be closer, while Deepa and Anish feel that the school would be closer, Hardeep thinks that both would be almost at an equal distance (Fig. 5.9).

When distance is stated with respect to a fixed object or point, then this point is called a reference point. A few days later, Hardeep tells his friends excitedly, “Let us all go to the playground.

She looked around again after a minute and found them still occupying their seats. She wondered, ‘Are they moving?’ She concluded that the position of the passengers was not changing with time. Therefore, they were certainly at rest. However, when she looked outside, she felt they were in motion as their positions were changing with respect to things outside. The reference point is important in deciding whether an object is at rest or in motion. If Deepa considered herself (or the bus) as the reference point, then the passengers were at rest. However, if she considered any object outside the bus (say a building) as the reference point, then the passengers (and the bus) were in motion.

Reprint 2025-26 102 Table 6.1: Identify materials I observe Materials they are made up of The earliest pottery found in the Indian subcontinent dates back to 7,000 to 8,000 years in the Ganga plains (Lahuradewa) and in Baluchistan (Mehrgarh). About 4000 BCE onwards, Sindhu-Sarasvatī developed techniques of wheel- turned pottery production, pigmentation, application of protective or decorative coats (called ‘slips’) of multiple colours, decorative painting, etc. These techniques became further sophisticated during the Sindhu-Sarasvatī (also known as ‘Harappan’) Civilisation (2600–1900 BCE), with a bright red surface painted with black-coloured designs displaying geometric patterns, and aquatic and terrestrial animals. The clay used for making pots, dishes, bowls and other items was carefully selected and cleaned, sieved, kneaded, turned over a wheel and finally baked in kilns (baked clay is called ‘terracotta’). Pots were used for various purposes, from cooking to storage of food grains, oil, ghee, and so on. Some very large storage jars and other pottery items are exhibited at the National Museum, New Delhi. others?” All things are made up of some materials like paper, wood, cloth, glass, metal, plastic, clay, and so on.

You must have noticed that an object can be made from different materials and some materials can be used to make more than one object. The method of arranging the objects into groups is called classification. Objects can be classified on the basis of a common property that they have. Similarly, we can classify materials based on certain properties. Materials Around Us Reprint 2025-26 104 Activity 6.3: Let us think Let us think what materials we can use to make a tumbler.

We may use different materials for making different parts of an object. For example, a pen may be made up of different materials like plastic, metal and ink. Would it be a good idea to use paper-like materials for making cooking utensils? ? Why cannot a tumbler made of cloth be used for storing water?

Observe Fig. 6.4 and group the objects in as many different ways as possible. You might have grouped these objects according to their shapes or by their colour or materials they are made up of. We have learnt that materials may be classified on the basis of their properties. For example, in the kitchen, we usually store things in such a manner where similar utensils are placed together. Similarly, a grocer usually keeps all types of spices in one corner, pulses and grains in another corner and so on. You may also visit any chemist shop and enquire about how medicines are arranged. 6.3 What are the different Properties of Materials? Let us learn some more properties of materials. 6.3.1 \u0007Observe and identify appearance of materials Materials often look different from each other. Freshly cut wood, which is unpolished, has a distinct appearance, quite different from that of iron. Similarly, iron looks different from copper or aluminium. However, there might be some similarities among iron, copper and aluminium that make them different from wood. Let us do a sorting challenge!

Observe their texture (whether Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 Reprint 2025-26 107 rough or smooth), colour and other noticeable features, and record your observations in the notebook. Group the collected pieces based on their appearance. Materials that typically have shiny surfaces are said to have a lustrous appearance. Such materials with lustre are usually metals. Examples of metals include iron, copper, zinc, aluminium, gold, etc. However, some metals may lose their lustre and start to look dull or non-lustrous due to the effect of air and moisture on them. As a result, we often notice the lustre only on their freshly cut surfaces. Non-lustrous materials are those that do not have a shiny surface. Some examples of non-lustrous materials are paper, wood, rubber, jute, etc. “All that glitters is not gold” goes an old saying! Not all the materials that shine are metals. Surfaces of some materials are made shiny by polishing or coating them with thin layers of plastic, wax or any other material which makes them look shiny. These materials may not be metals. 6.3.2 Which materials are hard? When you press different objects or materials with your hands, some of them like stones, may be hard to compress, while others, like an eraser, can be easily compressed. Take a metal key and use it to scratch the surface of a piece of wood, aluminium, stone, iron, candle, chalk and any other material or object. Can some materials be scratched more easily than others?

ORS—Oral Rehydration Solution— is used to treat dehydration due to diarrhoea or other illnesses. These ready-made ORS packets are available in primary health centres and also in the market. Each packet is dissolved in a litre of water before use. If these are not available, ORS can be prepared at home by mixing six teaspoons of sugar and half a teaspoon of common salt in one litre of boiled and cooled water. Some liquids get completely mixed with water. Some do not mix with water and form a separate layer when left undisturbed for some time. Similarly, some gases are soluble in water whereas others are not. For example, oxygen gas dissolves in water. It is very important for the survival of animals and plants that live in water. 6.3.5 How heavy or light? Activity 6.8: Let us measure   Let us take three identical paper cups (or bowls).

On pouring water in the glass tumblers, the students observe that one glass tumbler gets half- filled with water (Fig. 6.8a) while the other is almost completely filled with water (Fig. 6.8b). Materials Around Us Reprint 2025-26 114 Why is the level of water different in the two tumblers? Madam Vidya elaborates that both tumblers have the same capacity. The water levels differ in each case, which indicates that the amount of water in each tumbler is different. The water in the first tumbler occupies less space, indicating that the volume of water in this tumbler is less than the water in the other tumbler. The space occupied by water represents its volume. You may have noticed drinking water bottles of different sizes being sold in the market. Have you noticed 1 L, 500 mL, 200 mL, etc., written as net quantity on the bottles? These indicate the volume of water in the bottles. The bottles of drinking water and milk are labelled as 500 mL, indicating the volume.

However, all materials do not possess all these properties. Are there any properties which can be shown by all materials? If yes, what are those? ? 6.4 What is Matter? Mass and volume are the two properties that are possessed by all materials. Can we give a general name to anything that possesses these two properties? Anything that occupies space and has mass is called matter. The mass gives the quantity of matter, and the units to measure it are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). The space occupied by matter is its volume. The units to measure the volume are litre (L) and millilitre (mL). Kilogram is the unit of mass in the International System of Units (SI). Kilogram is abbreviated in lower case as kg. There is no space between ‘k’ and ‘g’ in kg, and no full stop after the symbol, except at the end of a sentence. While writing the mass, always leave a space between the number (numerical value) and the unit. For example, if we have mass of 7 kilograms, it would be written as 7 kg and not as 7 kgs. Similarly, litre is abbreviated as capital L and millilitre as mL. There is no space between ‘m’ and ‘L’ in mL. For example, if you have 500 millilitres of water, it would be written as 500 mL, m will be in lower case and L will be in upper case. The SI unit for volume is cubic metre, abbreviated as m3. The abbreviation is written with a superscript 3 to denote cubic metre. For example, if you have volume of 2 cubic metres, it would be written as 2 m3. Always leave a space between number (numerical value)"}

Materials Around Us Reprint 2025-26 116 Can all the materials around us be considered as different examples of matter? Discuss with your friends. For example, water is matter, sand and pebbles are matter and so is the cup. Materials are types of matter used in the creation or making of objects. We learnt that materials look different and behave differently. We grouped materials on the basis of similarities or differences in their properties. We find grouping useful as it helps us study and observe patterns in the properties of things. Humans have been classifying not only things, but also rocks, plants and animals. We have learnt about the classification of the living world in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Just like in the living world, classification of the non-living world is also done on the basis of their properties. Is air matter? Yes! But most of the materials that we see today would have also existed earlier. I am curious to know how people classified them then. We have explored and understood the various properties of materials.

One day they came home from school. Their parents were away at work and Lambok complained that he was feeling feverish. Phiban touched his forehead and felt that he might be having a fever. To confirm this, she took out the thermometer kept in the almirah. She washed its tip with soap and water, and measured Lambok’s temperature. To her relief, she found that his temperature was normal. She washed the thermometer tip again, dried Wrong measurements are worse than no measurements at all. — Anna Mani 7.1 Hot or Cold? We know from experience that some bodies are hotter than others.

Earlier, mercury thermometers were used for measuring the body temperature. But mercury is an extremely toxic substance and is difficult to dispose of if the thermometer breaks accidently. Digital thermometers pose no such risk and also the numbers in its display are easier to read. Therefore, mercury thermometers are being replaced by digital thermometers. Temperature in a digital thermometer is determined with the help of heat sensors. temperature when the thermometer is placed in contact with a person’s body.

But in this activity, did you find that the normal temperature of every person was 37.0 °C? Or did you find the temperature slightly higher or lower for some people? The temperature of every person may not be 37.0 °C. What we call normal temperature is the average body temperature of a large number of healthy people. A perfectly healthy person may, therefore, have a normal temperature slightly different from 37.0 °C. The body temperature is influenced by several factors, such as age, time of the day and activity level. You may try measuring your own temperature at different times of the day and on different days. Record the thermometer readings in your notebook. After a month, analyse your temperature record and see if there are any variations. If yes, try to think what might be the reasons for that. The temperature of human beings does not normally go below 35 °C or above 42 °C. For measuring the body temperature of small children or old people, the digital thermometer can also be placed in the armpit. The temperature measured this way is about 0.5 °C to 1 °C lower than the actual body temperature."}

On this scale, the unit of temperature is degree Fahrenheit and is denoted by °F. A temperature measured as 37.0 °C on Celsius scale is equivalent to 98.6 °F on Fahrenheit scale. The Fahrenheit scale is not used in most scientific studies anymore. In scientific work, there is another scale of temperature known as Kelvin scale. On this scale, the unit for temperature is kelvin and is denoted by K. The SI unit of temperature is kelvin. Do small children generally have slightly higher body temperatures as compared to adults? ? Do old people, even when healthy, generally have lower body temperatures than young adults? ?

All three temperature scales, Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin are named in honour of the scientists who developed these scales. How was fever detected before thermometers were developed? Fever affects the pulse rate of a person. This was known even in olden days in India. However, apart from fever, some other situations also affect the pulse rate. Hence, pulse rate alone is not a reliable indicator of fever. Do you know? No, the temperatures of boiling water and ice are outside the range of a clinical thermometer.

After looking at the ice in the lemonade, Thirav wonders about the nature of ice and water. Aavi has a counterview to Thirav. What do you think? Why? Do you think Thirav is right? How can you find out? If it does not rain well, even the mighty ocean will be drained. (Thirukkural) We can put water in the freezer of a refrigerator and check if it gets converted into ice. No, these are the same substances. Ice feels hard to touch and we can hold it in our hands, whereas, water cannot be held in the same way. So, they must be different substances. Yes, I know when water is left in the freezer, it gets converted into ice but probably something gets added to the ice in the freezer.

Water splashes but ice does not. 8.1 Investigating Water’s Disappearing Act It is a rainy morning. While going to school, Aavi and Thirav observe that there are a lot of water puddles in the playground. That evening, when they go to play, they are surprised to observe that some of the water in the puddles had disappeared. Have you ever noticed water in the puddles disappearing? Where does it go? Discuss with your friends. Where else have you seen water disappearing? Can you think of a possible reason why this happens? You might have observed that after washing the utensils, water left on the surface of the utensils, dries up after some time. Does the reason you thought earlier to explain water disappearance apply in this case also? Aavi wonders if water has seeped through the surface of the utensils. Thirav thinks that water does not seep through the surface of the utensils. Design an activity to investigate whose idea is correct.

What do you infer? Is this activity enough to come to the conclusion that water does not seep through a steel plate? If water does not seep through the steel plate. Then, where has the water gone? This water gets converted into gaseous state called water vapour. The water vapour is another state of water. Let us think of another observation where you notice the water disappearing. While making dosa, we sprinkle some water on the hot pan and it disappears. Where does it go? Fig. 8.1: Steel plate with a tablespoon of water The water which is sprinkled on the hot pan gets converted into steam. Steam is actually water vapour, some part of which converts into water droplets. The process of conversion of water into its vapour state is called evaporation. The process of evaporation takes place continuously, even at room temperature. Can you think of other examples of evaporation? Drying of wet clothes, mopped floor, and sweat on our body are some examples of it. Now what do you think is the reason for the disappearance of water from the puddles? Is it due to: (i) seeping of water into the ground or (ii) evaporation of water or (iii) both of these? Hand sanitiser disappears as you rub it on your hands. What happens to it?

The process of conversion of water vapour into its liquid state is called condensation. After understanding the concept of condensation of water, let us go back to Activity 8.3.

Water is a substance that can be observed in three different states in our daily life. In the solid state, it exists as ice. On heating, the ice melts and gets converted into its liquid state. On further heating, water gets converted into its gaseous state. Let us perform Activity 8.5 to identify the properties of different states of water. Activity 8.5: Let us identify   Put an ice cube in one container and transfer it to another container of different shape. What changes do you notice in the shape of the ice cube? Record your observations in Table 8.3.   Pour water from one container to another container of a different shape. Observe how water behaves compared to the ice cube and make a record. Did you notice how water flows from one container to the other? What happens to its shape?   Pour water on a clean surface and observe how it spreads.   When water gets converted into water vapour, how does this water vapour spread?

Table 8.3: Compare different states of water Property Ice (Solid state) Water (Liquid state) Water vapour (Gaseous state) Shape Ability to flow Ability to spread Reprint 2025-26 A Journey through States of Water 151 What are the differences in the properties of water in solid, liquid and gaseous states? Ice (solid state) retains its shape irrespective of the container in which it is placed while water takes the shape of the container. Ice does not flow or spread. Water (liquid state) flows and changes its shape. Water does not have a fixed shape. It takes up the shape of the container in which it is kept, but the volume of water remains constant. Does water also possess the property to spread? Yes, water also has the property to spread while keeping the volume constant. Water vapour (gaseous state) exhibits a property of spreading out in the entire available space. Gases do not possess a fixed shape. Water vapour exists even at room temperature; though it is invisible to us. It is present in the air around us. The water that evaporates during processes like drying of clothes or mopping of floors contribute to the water vapour in the air around us. You are now familiar with the three states of water. Some other substances also exhibit these states. For example, wax, oil and ghee. Let us look at some more examples of solids, liquids and gases. Look around and find some examples of solid substances. Some examples could be stones, wood and glass. What are the other examples of liquids you can think of? Here are two examples— milk and oil.

It is because the smell of yummy food from cooking spreads through the air and reaches our nostrils, even if we are not in the kitchen. What are the other examples of gases you can think of? What about oxygen and carbon dioxide? 8.4 How can we change the States of Water? So far we have learnt that water can exist in solid, liquid and gaseous states. How can you change the state of water?

If we have to change ice into water, and water into water vapour, we have to supply heat to it. If we want to change water into ice, what should be done? It can be done by placing water in a cold environment, such as a freezer. Water freezes and is converted into ice. If we take the ice out of the freezer, it melts and is converted into water. Can you think of any other example, besides water, that can change from solid to liquid? A candle, which is made of wax, is one such example. How can we turn candle wax into liquid state?

You all may be familiar with this unique clay pot which is called Surahi (Fig. 8.8). In summers, surahi is used to keep the water cold. 8.7 How do Clouds give us Rain? Condensation plays a significant role in the process of bringing evaporated water back to the Earth’s surface. How does this happen? When air moves higher above the Earth’s surface, it becomes cooler and cooler. At certain heights, the air gets so cool that the water vapour in it turns into droplets which are generally formed around dust particles. These small droplets float in the air and form clouds. Many droplets join together to form bigger drops of water. Some drops get so heavy that they start falling. These falling water drops are what we call rain. Fig. 8.8: A surahi Why does air containing water vapour go up in the atmosphere (thin layer of air that surrounds the Earth)? As we know, gas balloons containing lighter gases go up in the air. Similarly, water vapour is lighter than air, causing it to rise. Do you know?

This circulation of water is known as the water cycle. Only a small portion of water available on the Earth is fit for use by plants, animals and humans. Most of the water is in the oceans and it cannot be used directly. We use water for drinking and also for many other activities. The number of people using water is increasing with a rise in population. The increasing demand for water causes its shortage in many parts of the world. Hence, it is very important to use water wisely and avoid wasting it. Let us keep our water bodies free from pollution.

They always stay in touch with their relatives and friends. Do you also keep in touch with your loved ones? Their first halt is at their Nani’s (maternal grandmother’s) house in Haryana. It is surrounded by large fields. Malli and Valli are fascinated by the variety of grains piled up in the courtyard.

To keep them busy, Nani gives them a challenge of handpicking small stones from grains while keeping their eyes closed. The method of picking by hand from a mixture (when two or more substances are mixed) such as small stones and husk from wheat and rice is called handpicking. It is done on the basis of differences in size, colour and shape of the particles. If the particles to be removed are present in small quantities and can easily be picked by hand, handpicking proves to be a convenient method. At lunch, Malli and Valli are served steaming hot vegetable pulao. While eating the pulao, Nani observes that Malli is separating whole black peppers from the pulao and is placing them aside on his plate (Fig. 9.1). Valli playfully teases, “Wow! This is a handpicking method, nice one!” Nani tells them about the benefits of black pepper and encourages Malli to eat it. Later in the day, their Mama takes them to the fields where they observe bundles of harvested wheat stalks lying in the fields. Some stalks are spread in the sun for drying. Both of them pick up a stalk each and notice numerous grains attached to it. A group of farmers are beating the stalks on a large wooden log.

For instance, a car does not grow. Does it mean it is non-living? Now, which characteristics have you used to classify a car as non-living? Continue your discussion in a similar way to identify the essential characteristics of living beings. What are some common characteristics that make living beings very different from the non-living things? Let us learn about them. Can we consider movement as one of the characteristics to differentiate between the living and the non-living? List five things around you that can move on their own. Do you think that all five things that you have listed can be considered as living just because they can move on their own? However, unlike animals, plants do not move from one place to another. Do you consider them as living? Even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show certain types of movements. Opening of flowers is one of the examples of movement in plants. Another example of movement in plants is seen in insectivorous plants. Insectivorous plants are dependent on insects for their nutrition. Drosera is one of the examples of an insectivorous plant. Drosera is featured with saucer-shaped leaves having many hair-like projections of unequal length with sticky ends. Whenever an insect enters the saucer, hairs move inward and trap the insect with their sticky ends. Try to observe the mechanism of movement in other insectivorous plants. Climbers also wind themselves around any object placed close to them. That means, even though plants do not move from one place to another, they do show some movements.

Can you Growth of a child Drosera Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 186 wear the dress that you used to wear four years ago? No, because you have become larger in size. This is due to growth in your body. Plants and other living beings also grow. Can we consider growth as a characteristic of living beings? Living beings need food (nutrition) for their growth and development. List five living beings that require food to grow. Now, think of a process without which we cannot live. Count the number of breaths you take per minute after a normal walk, after a run, and after a few dance steps. Record the data and observe. Do you notice any difference in the number of breaths after each situation? Do you notice the process of breathing in other animals like dogs, cats, cows and buffaloes? Notice the movement of their abdomen while they are taking rest. In the process of breathing, when we inhale, the air moves from outside to inside our body. When we breathe out, the air moves from inside our body to outside. Breathing is part of a process called respiration. Do plants also respire? There are tiny pores called stomata on the surface of leaves. These pores help plants in taking air in and out.

Interact with senior class students in your school and request if they can demonstrate stomata using a microscope in your class. All living beings respire. Have you noticed white patches forming on shirts around the armpits during summers? These patches are formed due to sweat. The sweat consists of water and salts removed by the body as waste products. Removal of waste products from the body is called excretion. Urine is also formed as a product of excretion in animals. Do you know that plants also excrete? You may notice plants excrete excess water and minerals in the form of small droplets on leaves. For example, grasses and roses. All living beings excrete. Let us look at another characteristic. What is your reaction if you unexpectedly step on a sharp object, such as a thorn, Water droplets on grass Reprint 2025-26 Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics 187 while walking without shoes, or you accidentally touch a hot cup of tea? Stepping on a thorn and touching a hot object are stimuli. Any thing or any event that prompts living beings to respond is called a stimulus. List three stimuli (plural of stimulus) and your body’s instant response to them. Do plants also respond to stimuli? Yes, plants also respond to stimuli. For example, touch- me-not (mimosa, chhui-mui, lajjalu) plants fold their leaves when we touch them. Have you also observed that certain plants fold their leaves after sunset? Specifically, the leaves of certain plants facing each other tend to come together. This can be observed in the sleeping leaves of amla (Indian gooseberry) tree. All living beings respond to stimuli.

List young ones of five different animals. Have you seen young ones of any non-living things such as a pencil, a chair or an electric bulb? All living beings reproduce. Reproduction is the process of producing new ones of one’s own kind. Why is reproduction necessary? It is necessary for the continuity of life. When a living being is not able to exhibit all of the above mentioned characteristics, despite the availability of all resources (like food, air and water) needed for being alive, it is said to be dead. From the above discussion, we can understand that all living beings share some common characteristics. For example, all living beings show movement, they need Touch-me-not (chhui-mui) plant Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 188 food, and they grow.

Why do seeds require these conditions for germination? Do you think that the absence of one or more of these conditions will affect seed germination? Let us understand how these conditions help in seed germination. The effects of the following conditions have been seen in Activity 10.2. Water: Seeds require water for germination. Water enables the seeds to carry out the processes necessary for their growth. The outer covering of the seed is called seed coat. Water softens the seed coat and helps the tiny embryo inside it to develop into a plant. Air and Soil: Seeds need air for germination. They use the air available in the spaces between soil particles. Moreover, spaces between the soil particles allow roots to grow easily. Light and/or dark conditions: We have learnt that for the bean seeds, presence of light is not essential for their germination. In general, most seeds do not require light for germination. But after germination, sunlight is required for further growth of the seedling.

Fig. 10.5: Larvae and pupae of mosquitoes in a stagnant water body Pupa Larva Mosquito larvae and pupae observed in water bodies repeatedly come to the water surface. What can be the reason for this? Mosquito larvae and pupae live in water and require air to respire. They move to the surface of the water for air. How can the life cycle of a mosquito be disrupted? I have seen my mother spraying kerosene oil on stagnant water. Why does she do so? Kerosene oil forms a thin layer over the water surface. This layer separates water from air, and does not allow larvae and pupae to inhale air. As a result, they die. ?

Fig. 10.6: Life cycle of a mosquito Stage IV (Adult mosquito) Stage I (Egg) Stage III (Pupa) Stage II (Larva) Reprint 2025-26 Let us learn more about these stages in the life cycle of a mosquito. Mosquitoes pass through four stages in their life cycle— egg, larva, pupa and adult (Fig. 10.6). The adult mosquito that emerges from the pupa rests briefly on the surface of water and then flies away. The adult mosquito may survive for 10 to 15 days. We have seen that a mosquito begins its life as an egg (stage I), the egg develops into a larva (stage II), the larva grows into pupa (stage III), and the pupa transforms into an adult mosquito (stage IV). The adult female mosquito lays eggs directly on or near water, and the cycle continues. Significant changes occur in the appearance, body shape and structure during the various stages in the life cycle of a mosquito.

Is it easy to imagine that a mosquito emerges from a pupa? The silk moth also passes through four life stages—egg, larva, pupa and adult. Eggs hatch into larvae, which then grow in size. Larvae secrete thread-like material which they wrap around themselves, before changing to pupae. These are the fibres that are used to make silk fabric. In India, the Khadi and Village Industries Commission (KVIC) has set up several centres for silk production.

Absence of any of these features indicates that they are not living beings.   Each living being goes through several stages during its life.   Germination of seeds depends upon the availability of water, air and suitable light and/or dark conditions.   During germination of seeds, roots generally grow downwards, while shoots grow upwards.   A plant’s life cycle starts with seed germination, followed by several stages of its growth and development. These include flowering and seed production. Seeds produced during their life cycle would germinate into new plants and the cycle continues.   The life cycle of an animal as a result of reproduction, begin with a newborn that undergoes various stages of growth and development followed by an adult stage and finally death."}

From this activity, we find that it is difficult to hold our breath for a long time. The air which we breathe in has oxygen. Our body needs oxygen to perform its functions. When we hold our breath for a long time, the body does not get enough oxygen to perform its functions. Thus, we need oxygen for our survival. Similarly, most of the living beings also need oxygen for their survival. Breathing exercise Caution Do not hold your breath for so long that you start feeling uncomfortable. Reprint 2025-26 Nature’s Treasures 209 We can survive without food or water for a few days, but we cannot survive without oxygen for even a few minutes. Do you know? Fig. 11.1: Composition of air You notice the presence of air when the leaves of a tree rustle, the clothes hanging on a clothes line sway, or the pages of an open book begin to flutter once a fan is switched on.

Waste from homes and industries pollute our water sources when it is dumped into them. Identify other human activities that lead to water pollution. Discuss with your friends in the class what you can do to reduce water pollution. Polluted water is not fit for consumption by living beings. As freshwater sources are limited, there is a shortage of water in many parts of India. At some places, people have to walk long distances to fetch drinking water. Everyone does not have the same kind of access to water. It is important for us to conserve water and use it judiciously. We must also prevent it from being polluted so that water remains fit for consumption by all living beings. In what ways can you conserve water? Water harvesting is one of the methods for conserving water. In many buildings, rainwater is collected and stored in large quantities for later use. This is called rainwater harvesting (Fig. 11.4a). Do you know that rainwater is also harvested in many homes, residential societies or schools? It is an age-old practice in India. For example, stepwells (Fig. 11.4b), commonly known as Bawadi in Rajasthan and Vav in Gujarat are built for water harvesting as a response to the scarcity of water in these regions. These stepwells have a unique system of water harvesting. They store not only rainwater but also water seeping from nearby lakes, ponds and rivers. The walls"}

A forest Reprint 2025-26 Nature’s Treasures 217 Discuss with your friends and make a list of at least five products that we get from forests. Forests are a natural home for many wild animals, including birds and insects. Forests provide food and shelter to them. In nature, every animal depends on other life forms for survival. The diversity of life forms ensures food for every living being. However, over the years, the forest cover has been decreasing, mainly due to human activities like large scale cutting of trees. It takes many years to grow a new forest or restore lost forests. Therefore, we must preserve and use forests responsibly so that they get enough time to regenerate. Van Mahotsav is a week- long event celebrated across the country during the month of July. It is a forest festival during which new plants and trees are planted, and awareness about respecting forests is raised. The aim of the event is to increase the green cover. You too can plan a Van Mahotsav in your community. From ancient times, India had a tradition of respecting, protecting and preserving forests. You have already learnt about sacred groves in the chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’. Many efforts have been made by common people to prevent the cutting of trees, and thus, saving forests. One such effort is the famous Chipko movement. It started in the early 1970s in Uttarakhand (previously part of Uttar Pradesh). Local women actively participated in this movement. They encircled and hugged the trees to protect them from being felled. Do you know? What are the consequences of cutting a large forest area? Make a presentation or do a role"}

Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 218 During their walk in the forests, Bhoomi and Surya notice that there are a lot of leaves on the ground and the soil feels damp. Ajji explains, “The roots of plants hold on to the soil and prevent it from being washed away. The leaves that fall from the trees decay and enrich the soil with nutrients. This soil is used by new plants and trees to grow. This is an example of recycling in nature.” Let us investigate the soil in more detail. 11.5 Soil, Rocks and Minerals Bhoomi, Surya and Ajji come back home from the forest. Bhoomi and Surya help Ajji in preparing the soil in the garden for planting some vegetables (Fig. 11.5). Ajji asks them to dig the soil gently and loosen the lumps. You have already learnt in the chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’ that for plants to grow, the space between the soil particles not only provides sufficient air but also space for the roots to grow easily. Bhoomi and Surya could see small pebbles, the roots of plants and a few earthworms too in the soil. Do you realise that earthworms are natural agents that help in turning and loosening the soil?

Nowadays, less polluting natural gas and Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) have gradually replaced these domestic fuels. Do you know? Type of vehicle Type of fuel used Table 11.3: Types of vehicles and fuels used What are the most common types of fuels used? Petrol and diesel are the two most widely used fuels for vehicles. Petrol, diesel and kerosene are obtained from petroleum. Petroleum along with natural gas and coal are commonly called fossil fuels. They are formed essentially from the remains of microorganisms and plants that got buried deep inside the earth, and were converted to petroleum, natural gas and coal. It takes millions of years for these fuels to form. Natural gas is used for cooking and generating electricity. Nowadays, it is also used in the form of Compressed Natural Gas (CNG) as a fuel for vehicles. It is a cleaner fuel than petrol or diesel. Coal is mainly used for the production of electricity. It is found in several parts of India. Find out the major coal-producing states and mark them in a map of India. Reprint 2025-26 Nature’s Treasures 223 Fossil fuels are found in limited quantities. Hence, we will soon run out of fossil fuels if we continue to use them in the manner that we currently do. To avoid such a situation, we need to explore alternate sources of energy. When fossil fuels are burnt, smoke and carbon dioxide gas are produced which pollutes the air. Over-dependence on fossil fuels for transportation and as domestic fuels has resulted in large scale air pollution. 11.7 Natural Resources: renewable and non-renewable Nature’s treasures fulfill our needs.

They are essential resources to sustain all life forms on the Earth. For example, we get heat and light from the Sun, water from rivers, and food from plants and animals. These resources which we get from nature are called natural resources. We also use natural resources to make many useful things for our convenience. For example, electric bulbs, furniture, solar panels, bicycles, etc., make our lives comfortable. All such resources created by human beings are called human-made resources.

They are not produced or replenished within a reasonable period of time. These resources are called non-renewable resources. Examples of non-renewable natural resources are minerals, soil, rocks, coal, petroleum and natural gas. 11.8 Resources we use It is time for Bhoomi and Surya to go back home after a wonderful holiday at their Ajji’s home. Their Amma (mother) comes to pick them up. Bhoomi and Surya show her the vegetable plants that have started to grow in the garden and the dried chillies given by Ajji to take home. They notice changes in the colour of the skyline and the smell of the air once they reach the city. There are very few trees. The air does not smell as good as the air at Ajji’s place. They can smell smoke from the vehicles. The air is polluted. Amma says, “Yes. When we use fossil fuels in our vehicles, smoke is generated. Now, there are vehicles which cause less pollution. For example, there are electric vehicles that do not release any smoke. So, people are making an effort to create alternatives.” Can you list some alternatives for reducing air pollution?

Currently, the regions of sky, which include these groups of stars, are defined as constellations. However, since in constellations, the patterns of stars are often the most prominent, the term constellation is still commonly used for these groups of stars. Do we find patterns among the stars just for fun or is there some use of these patterns? Since different cultures denoted the constellation boundaries in different ways, an internationally agreed set of constellation boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in the early twentieth century. 88 constellations were officially listed, thus, dividing the entire sky into 88 regions. These regions of sky are now defined as constellations. More to know! Some constellations are shown in Fig. 12.3. The stars are joined by imaginary lines, drawn for easy identification.

If you stay in a big city, you may find that the sky is rarely clear and only a few stars are seen in the night sky. This is due to light pollution, smoke and dust. The presence of excessive artificial light at night time is referred to as light pollution. In villages or areas where there is less light pollution, a larger number of stars can be seen. Also, your house may be surrounded by tall buildings and trees, which may block your view. The night sky is best viewed from open dark areas. Light pollution is growing sharply globally.

In India, the Sun is worshipped as Sūrya. The heat provided by the Sun keeps the Earth at a temperature that makes life possible. Sunlight is essential for plants to grow, which provide food and oxygen to animals, including humans. The Sun is responsible for climate, seasons, weather, water cycle, winds—all of which are important for sustaining life on the Earth. The distance of the Sun from the Earth is about 150 million km. A useful unit for expressing distances within the solar system is ‘astronomical unit’ (au) which is approximately the distance between the Sun and the Earth. The Sun produces heat and light, and is the main source of energy on the Earth (Fig. 12.6). How big is the Sun? It is about 100 times bigger than the Earth in diameter. And still, it looks so small because it is very far from the Earth. However, the Sun is much closer to us than the other stars hence it appears much bigger than the stars. As the stars (other than the Sun) are much farther away, they appear like points, even though some of those stars are much bigger Our Sun is also a star.

While revolving around the Sun, the Earth is also rotating about its axis. For one full rotation, the Earth takes about 24 hours which is called a day. Like the Earth, other planets also rotate about their axes while revolving around the Sun. You will learn more about this in the next Grade. More to know! Planets A planet is a large, nearly spherical object that revolves around the Sun. Our Earth is a planet as it revolves around the Sun as shown in Fig. 12.7. The Earth takes nearly one year to complete one revolution. Like the Earth, there are other planets that revolve around the Sun. The star nearest to us after the Sun is Proxima Centauri which lies at a distance of about 269000 au. This means that its distance is about 269000 times our distance to the Sun. More to know! There are many more objects in the sky. Our Earth, along with some of these objects, and the Sun together form our Solar System (Fig. 12.7). Most of these objects move around the Sun. The movement of an object around the Sun is called revolution. Are stars the only objects in the sky? Or, are there more objects which we may not have noticed?

The eight planets, in order of their increasing distance from the Sun, are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune (Fig. 12.7).

Reprint 2025-26 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 6 242 Venus is usually seen shining brightly at dawn and dusk, and is commonly called the Morning Star or the Evening Star, even though it is not a star. Mars is called the Red Planet because it appears red. This is because the soil on Mars is reddish in colour. A large portion of the Earth’s surface is covered with water and thus, it appears blue from the space. Due to this, the Earth is also called the Blue Planet.

These giant gaseous planets have large flat ring-like structures around them which are made of dust particles and rocky material. Planets get most of their energy from the Sun. So, the farther they are, the colder they are in general. The presence of an atmosphere on a planet can trap heat which can significantly change the temperature of a planet. That is why Venus, for example, is hotter than Mercury, although it is farther from the Sun. There is another object called Pluto that lies farther than Neptune, and revolves around the Sun. It is smaller than the Earth’s Moon. When it was discovered, it was called a planet of the Solar System. But later, when similar more small objects were discovered, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) in 2006 redefined the requirements of an object to be called a planet. As per this definition, these smaller objects, including Pluto, are now called dwarf planets. More to know! Can we identify a planet also, the way we identified the constellations? Among the planets, it is easiest to identify Venus which is very bright. After the Sun and the Moon, Venus is the brightest object in the sky.

While many of the objects in the sky can be seen with our naked eyes directly, we can see them brighter and larger using a pair of binoculars or an instrument called a telescope (Fig. 12.8). A telescope also helps us view many dim objects not visible by our naked eyes directly. You may get an opportunity to view the sky through a telescope whenever a night sky watching event is organised in your region. Many Higher Education Institutions conduct night sky watching activities for school students. There are many Amateur Astronomy Clubs all over the country which organise sky watching events periodically. Museums and Planetariums also organise similar events. Do you know?

Unlike on the Earth, there is hardly any atmosphere on the Moon. How big is the Moon as compared to the Earth? The Moon is about a quarter the size of the Earth in diameter. The Moon’s surface shows circular bowl-like structures called craters (Fig. 12.9). Most of these craters have been formed due to the impact of asteroids or rocks from the space hitting the Moon’s surface.

There are many small objects in the Solar System which are rocky and irregular in shape. These are called asteroids. Many of these asteroids revolve around the Sun in paths that lie between those of Mars and Jupiter. This region is called the asteroid belt (Fig. 12.7). Occasionally, asteroids pass very close to the Earth. Comets Sometimes we have visitors from the outer regions of the Solar System! These objects with long tails are called comets (Fig. 12.10).

These comets approach close to the Sun periodically. However, there are a few comets that escape and move out of the Solar System. Few other comets get broken up, or fall into the Sun or other planets when they approach them. Fig. 12.10: A Comet We have learnt about the objects which form the Solar System. Which are these objects? The Sun, eight planets, their moons, and many smaller objects including asteroids, and comets, together form the Solar System. The Sun—our star—is the largest and the heaviest object in the Solar System. The Sun produces almost all the energy in the Solar System. All other objects in our Solar System shine due to the sunlight that they reflect from their surfaces. In Sanskrit and a few other Indian languages, a comet is called Dhūmaketu. Various tribes in India also call it Pucchya-Taro (star with a tail) or Zendya- Taro (star like a flag). In many cultures, comets have been feared and it was earlier believed that comets bring bad luck.

The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages — including at least two languages native to India — to Science, Mathematics, Social Science, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy — a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of Mathematics for Grade 7, Part I, aligns with the expectations of NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, with respect to creating a spark for initiating mathematical thinking. This textbook designed for Grade 7 students, takes forward its journey through the world of mathematics that started in Grade 6. During this journey the concepts and problems emerge from daily life situations and so it is expected that students will be able to relate to them with ease. The book makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore the patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS).

The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas such as science, social science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). Colourful illustrations and interactive exercises form the basis of this textbook that would develop a strong foundation among children in understanding more complex mathematical iv concepts. Throughout the book, stories, conversations and anecdotes have been incorporated to make abstract mathematical concepts more relatable and accessible to young learners. Puzzles and innovative problems will not only engage the students in thoughtfully relating the mathematical concepts to the world around them and help them in deepening their understanding of mathematics, but also prepare them to understand the concepts of the emerging field of computational thinking. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centered approach to education. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years.

Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational March 2025\b Research and Training ABOUT THE BOOK Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written). Mathematical knowledge also plays a crucial role in understanding concepts in other school subjects, such as Science and Social Science, and even Arts, Physical Education, and Vocational Education. Learning Mathematics can also contribute to the development of capacities for making informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus has an important role to play in achieving the overall aims of school education. Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and has to perform the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of the child and being abstract. It must perform the dual role of developing intuition while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It must perform the dual role of enhancing critical and logical thinking while also developing artistry and creativity and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Finally, Mathematics must perform the dual role of providing students plenty of opportunities for exploration and discovery of concepts on their own while also teaching best- known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics. The present textbook has made an attempt to address the above mentioned goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers of this book have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods to develop in students both intuition and rigour. The book also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning.

The book also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the book to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open- ended to stimulate in-class discussion. The first chapter of this book, ‘Large Numbers Around Us’, is an introduction to the world of lakhs and crores, and millions and billions through engaging explorations and contexts. Chapter 2, ‘Arithmetic Expressions’, considers expressions having multiple operations and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3, ‘A Peek Beyond the Point’, introduces the usage of the decimal point and additions and subtractions involving decimal numbers. Chapter 4, ‘Expressions using Letter-Numbers’ builds on the chapter on Arithmetic Expressions to guide students to take the first steps into the world of algebra. The fundamental notions of letter-numbers and algebraic expressions are introduced. Chapter 5, ‘Parallel and Intersecting Lines’, introduces some fundamental building blocks of geometry and has a balance of engaging activities like paper folding and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6, ‘Number Play’, covers aspects of computational thinking and problem solving through puzzles and concepts of parity, the Virahāṅka-Fibonacci sequence, and cryptarithms. Chapter 7, ‘A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines’, vi explores, through construction, some of the striking properties of a triangle related to the lengths of their sides and angles.

Chapter 8, ‘Working with Fractions’, builds on the students’ understanding of fractions, and explores the multiplication and division of fractions. The methods and formulas of the great Indian mathematician Brahmagupta (628 CE) for performing these operations on fractions is brought alive with fresh examples and interesting puzzles. In all chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History, and Science. By weaving together storytelling and hands-on activities, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give children the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other, provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage children to find many different ways to solve problems. As per the NEP 2020, computational thinking has also been gently introduced through puzzles, games, and interactive exercises that encourage such thinking. Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics. The concepts and problems are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials with which the students are familiar.

Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used. At many places, exercises or activities are given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. The textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom. We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers will use this as an opportunity to revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that children are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may give more time to the ideas of fractions, negative numbers and other notions that are new to students. Many of these are the basis for further learning in mathematics. Finally, this book aims to be more than just a textbook—it’s a passport to a world of mathematical discovery and exploration. Whether used in the classroom or at home, we hope that it may inspire students to embark on their own mathematical adventures, empowering them to see the beauty and relevance of mathematics in everything around them. With its engaging approach and comprehensive coverage of Grade 7 mathematics concepts, this book hopes and aims to captivate young minds and set them on a lifelong journey of mathematical discovery. vii I thank again all the writers of and contributors to this textbook for this important and valuable contribution and service to the nation’s mathematics teachers, learners and enthusiasts.

NOTE TO THE TEACHER We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you: that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next generation. This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms, where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one"}

Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions. Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups. Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics. It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students.

This icon is an indicator of a potential opportunity to start off a process of problem solving and exploration in the classroom. You will find some of the problems labelled “Math Talk”. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion. An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem-solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations. xii To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to “cover” all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them. It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration. Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others. This will also address the big problem that students face in speaking mathematics and interpreting word problems. This book contains a number of open-ended problems.

It is hoped that you and your students will have a great and fruitful time using this book! Summary of Key Points Time for Exploration 1. It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups. 2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. 3. There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems. About the Problems in the Book 1.

He visits the market regularly to buy seeds for his rice field. During one such visit he overheard a conversation between Ramanna and Lakshmamma. Ramanna said, “Earlier our country had about a lakh varieties of rice. Farmers used to preserve different varieties of seeds and use them to grow rice. Now, we only have a handful of varieties. Also, farmers have to come to the market to buy seeds”. Lakshmamma said, “There is a seed bank near my house. So far, they have collected about a hundred indigenous varieties of rice seeds from different places. You can also buy seeds from there.” You may have heard the word ‘lakh’ before. Do you know how big one lakh is? Let us find out. Eshwarappa shared this incident with his daughter Roxie and son Estu . Estu was surprised to know that there were about one lakh varieties of rice in this country. He wondered “One lakh! So far I have only tasted 3 varieties. If we tried a new variety each day, would we even come close to tasting all the varieties in a lifetime of 100 years?” What do you think? Guess.

Roxie suggests, “What if we ate 2 varieties of rice every day? Would we then be able to eat 1 lakh varieties of rice in 100 years?” What if a person ate 3 varieties of rice every day? Will they be able to taste all the lakh varieties in a 100 year lifetime? Find out. Estu said, “We know how many days there are in a year — 365, if we ignore leap years. If we live for y years, the number of days in our lifetime will be 365 × y.” 2 Large Numbers Around Us Choose a number for y. How close to one lakh is the number of days in y years, for the y of your choice? Figure it Out 1. According to the 2011 Census, the population of the town of Chintamani was about 75,000. How much less than one lakh is 75,000? 2. The estimated population of Chintamani in the year 2024 is 1,06,000. How much more than one lakh is 1,06,000? 3. By how much did the population of Chintamani increase from 2011 to 2024?

But, we can get a better sense of their size when we compare them with something familiar. Let us see an example. Look at the picture on the right. Somu is 1 metre tall. If each floor is about four times his height, what is the approximate height of the building? Which is taller — The Statue of Unity or this building? How much taller? ____________m. We can see that the height of the Statue of Unity is close to 4 times the height of Somu’s building. How much taller is the Kunchikal waterfall than Somu's building? ____________m.

Eshwarappa asked Roxie and Estu, “Is a lakh big or small?” Roxie feels that 1 lakh is a large number: • “We had one lakh varieties of rice — that is a lot.” • “Living 1 lakh days would mean living for 274 years — that is a really long time!” • “If 1 lakh people stood shoulder to shoulder in a line they could stretch as far as 38 kilometres.” Estu, however, thinks it is not that big: • “Do you know that the cricket stadium in Ahmedabad has a seating capacity of more than 1 lakh? One lakh people in such a small area!” • “Most humans"}

Reading and Writing Numbers We have already been using commas for 5-digit numbers like 45,830 in the Indian place value system. As numbers grow bigger, using commas helps in reading the numbers easily. We use a comma in between the digits representing the “ten thousands” place and the “one lakh” place as you have seen just before (1,00,000). The number name of 12,78,830 is twelve lakh seventy eight thousand eight hundred thirty. Similarly, the number 15,75,000 in words is fifteen lakh seventy five thousand.

In the American system, the digits are grouped uniformly in a 3-3-3-3… pattern from right to left (thousands, millions, billions, etc.). The Indian system of naming numbers is also followed in Bhutan, Nepal, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives, Afghanistan, and Myanmar. The words lakh and crore originate from the Sanskrit words lakṣha (लक्ष) and koṭi (कोटि‍). The American system is also used in many countries. Observe the number of zeroes in 1 lakh and 1 crore. 1 lakh, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 5 zeroes. 1 crore, written in numbers would be 1 followed by 7 zeroes. A lakh is a hundred times a thousand, a crore is a hundred times a lakh and an arab is a hundred times a crore (i.e., a hundred thousand is 1 lakh, 100 lakhs is 1 crore, and 100 crores is 1 arab).

Have you read or heard such headlines or statements? Very often, exact numbers are not required and just an approximation is sufficient. For example, according to the 2011 census, the population of Chintamani town is 76,068. Instead, saying that the population is about 75,000 is enough to give an idea of how big the quantity is. Bappi, call and check if Toofan Express is on time. What number did you call? I called the rounded off number, of course! My teacher told us that efficient people deal with rounded off numbers. There are situations where it makes sense to round up a number (rounding up is when the approximated number is more than the actual number). For example, if a school has 732 people including students, teachers and staff: the principal might order 750 sweets instead of 700 sweets. There are situations where it is better to round down (rounding down is when the approximated number is less than the actual number). For example, if the cost of an item is ₹470, the shopkeeper may say that the cost is around ₹450 instead of saying it is around ₹500. Think and share situations where it is appropriate to (a) round up, (b) round down, (c) either rounding up or rounding down is okay and (d) when exact numbers are needed. 10 Large Numbers Around Us Nearest Neighbours With large numbers it is useful to know the nearest thousand, lakh or crore.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 • We came across large numbers — lakhs, crores and arabs; millions and billions. We learnt how to read and write these numbers in the Indian and American/International naming systems. (a) 1 lakh is 1 followed by 5 zeroes: 1,00,000 (b) 1 crore is 1 followed by 7 zeroes: 1,00,00,000 (c) 1 million is 1 followed by 6 zeroes: 1,000,000 (which is also ten lakhs) (d) 1 arab is 1 followed by 9 zeroes: 1,000,000,000 (which is also 100 crore or 1 billion) • We generally round up or round down large numbers. Many times it is enough just to know roughly how big or small something is. • To get a sense of large numbers or quantities, we can check how many times bigger they are compared to numbers or quantities that are more familiar. • We saw how to factorise numbers and regroup them to make multiplications simpler. • We carried out interesting thought experiments such as — “Would one be able to watch 1000 movies in a year?” SUMMARY 22 Toothpick Digits We can write digits as shown in the image below: 0123456789 You can either use toothpicks or matchsticks, or just write the digits in this way, using lines to represent sticks.

Such phrases are called arithmetic expressions. Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’."}

Every arithmetic expression has a value which is the number it evaluates to. For example, the value of the expression 13 + 2 is 15. This expression can be read as ‘13 plus 2’ or ‘the sum of 13 and 2’. We use the equality sign ‘=’ to denote the relationship between an arithmetic expression and its value. For example: 13 + 2 = 15. Example 1: Mallika spends ₹25 every day for lunch at school. Write the expression for the total amount she spends on lunch in a week from Monday to Friday. The expression for the total amount is 5 × 25. 5 × 25 is “5 times 25” or “the product of 5 and 25”. Different expressions can have the same value. Here are multiple ways to express the number 12, using two numbers and any of the four operations +, – , × and ÷: 10 + 2, 15 – 3, 3 × 4, 24 ÷ 2.

Now he has 1022 + 128 marbles. Who has more? This situation can be represented as shown in the picture on the right. To begin with, Raja had 1 more marble than Joy. But Joy got 3 more marbles than Raja today. We can see that Joy has (two) more marbles than Raja now. That is, 1023 + 125 < 1022 + 128. Example 3: Which is greater? 113 – 25 or 112 – 24?

In such cases, we need some tools and rules to specify how exactly the expression has to be evaluated. To give an example with language, look at the following sentences: (a) Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend with toys”. \u0007Meaning: The friend has toys and Shalini sat next to her. (b) \u0007Sentence: “Shalini sat next to a friend, with toys”. Meaning: Shalini has the toys and she sat with them next to her friend. This sentence without the punctuation could have been interpreted in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how the sentence has to be understood. Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way. Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun brought 5 bags"}
{"id": "Ncert_class7_m+s_10750", "source": "Ncert_class7_m+s", "text": "punctuation could have been interpreted in two different ways. The appropriate use of a comma specifies how the sentence has to be understood. Let us see an expression that can be evaluated in more than one way. Example 4: Mallesh brought 30 marbles to the playground. Arun brought 5 bags of marbles with 4 marbles in each bag. How many marbles did Mallesh and Arun bring to the playground? Mallesh summarized this by writing the mathematical expression — 30 + 5 × 4. Arithmetic Expressions 27 Without knowing the context behind this expression, Purna found the value of this expression to be 140. He added 30 and 5 first, to get 35, and then multiplied 35 by 4 to get 140. Mallesh found the value of this expression to be 50. He multiplied 5 and 4 first to get 20 and added 20 to 30 to get 50. In this case, Mallesh is right. But why did Purna get it wrong? Just looking at the expression 30 + 5 × 4, it is not clear whether we should do the addition first or multiplication. Just as punctuation marks are used to resolve confusions in language, brackets and the notion of terms are used in mathematics to resolve confusions in evaluating expressions. Brackets in Expressions In the expression to find the number of marbles — 30 + 5 × 4 — we had to first multiply 5 and 4, and then add this product to 30. This order of operations is clarified by the use of brackets as follows: 30 + (5 × 4). When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value of 5 × 4,"}
{"id": "Ncert_class7_m+s_11000", "source": "Ncert_class7_m+s", "text": "clarified by the use of brackets as follows: 30 + (5 × 4). When evaluating an expression having brackets, we need to first find the values of the expressions inside the brackets before performing other operations. So, in the above expression, we first find the value of 5 × 4, and then do the addition. Thus, this expression describes the number of marbles: 30 + (5 × 4 ) = 30 + 20 = 50. Example 5: Irfan bought a pack of biscuits for ₹15 and a packet of toor dal for ₹56. He gave the shopkeeper ₹100. Write an expression that can help us calculate the change Irfan will get back from the shopkeeper. Irfan spent ₹15 on a biscuit packet and ₹56 on toor dal. So, the total cost in rupees is 15 + 56. He gave ₹100 to the shopkeeper. So, he should get back 100 minus the total cost. Can we write that expression as— 100 – 15 + 56 ? Can we first subtract 15 from 100 and then add 56 to the result? We will get 141. It is absurd that he gets more money than he paid the shopkeeper! We can use brackets in this case: 100 – (15 + 56). Evaluating the expression within the brackets first, we get 100 minus 71, which is 29. So, Irfan will get back ₹29. Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 28 Terms in Expressions Suppose we have the expression 30 + 5 × 4 without any brackets. Does it have no meaning? When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion of terms to determine the order. Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For example, in 12+7,"}

When there are expressions having multiple operations, and the order of operations is not specified by the brackets, we use the notion of terms to determine the order. Terms are the parts of an expression separated by a ‘+’ sign. For example, in 12+7, the terms are 12 and 7, as marked below. 12 7 + 12 + 7 = We will keep marking each term of an expression as above. Note that this way of marking the terms is not a usual practice. This will be done until you become familiar with this concept. Now, what are the terms in 83 – 14? We know that subtracting a number is the same as adding the inverse of the number. Recall that the inverse of a given number has the sign opposite to it. For example, the inverse of 14 is –14, and the inverse of –14 is 14. Thus, subtracting 14 from 83 is the same as adding –14 to 83. That is, 83 – 14 + 83 – 14 = Thus, the terms of the expression 83 – 14 are 83 and –14. Check if replacing subtraction by addition in this way does not change the value of the expression, by taking different examples. Can you explain why subtracting a number is the same as adding its inverse, using the Token Model of integers that we saw in the Class 6 textbook of mathematics? All subtractions in an expression are converted to additions in this manner to identify the terms. Here are some more examples of expressions and their terms: – 18 – 3 + –18 – 3 = 6 × 5 3 + 6 × 5 + 3 = 2 – 10 + 2 – 10 + 4 × 6 ="}

We will start with expressions having only additions (with all the subtractions suitably converted into additions). Does changing the order in which the terms are added give different values?

Write an expression to show how high the final position of the drone is from the terrace. The drone is 6 – 4 = 2 m above the terrace.

Removing Brackets — I Let us find the value of this expression, 200 – (40 + 3). We first evaluate the expression inside the bracket to 43 and then subtract it from 200. But it is simpler to first subtract 40 from 200: 200 – 40 = 160. And then subtract 3 from 160: 160 – 3 = 157. What we did here was 200 – 40 – 3. Notice, that we did not do 200 – 40 + 3. So, 200 – (40 + 3) = 200 – 40 – 3. Example 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a biscuit packet (₹15) and a toor dal packet (₹56).

Example 12: We also saw this earlier in the case of Irfan purchasing a biscuit packet (₹15) and a toor dal packet (₹56). When he paid ₹100, the change he gets in rupees is: 100 – (15 + 56) = 29. The change could also have been calculated as follows: (a) First subtract the cost of the biscuit packet (15) from 100: 100 – 15 = 85. This is the amount the shopkeeper owes Irfan if he had purchased only the biscuits. As he has purchased toor dal also, its cost is taken from this remaining amount of 85. (b) So, to find the change, we need to subtract the cost of toor dal from 85. 85 – 56 = 29. What we have done here is 100 – 15 – 56. So, 100 – (15 + 56) = 100 – 15 – 56.

Example 13: Consider the expression 500 – (250 – 100). Is it possible to write this expression without the brackets? To evaluate this expression, we need to subtract 250 – 100 = 150 from 500: 500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 150 = 350. If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression"}

If we were to directly subtract 250 from 500, then we would have subtracted 100 more than what we needed to. So, we should add back that 100 to 500 – 250 to make the expression take the same value as 500 – (250 – 100). This sequence of operations is 500 – 250+100. Thus, 500 – (250 – 100) = 500 – 250 + 100. Check that 500 – (250 – 100) is not equal to 500 – 250 – 100. Notice again that when the brackets preceded by a negative sign are removed, the signs of the terms inside the brackets change. In this case, the signs of 250 and – 100 change to – 250 and 100. Example 14: Hira has a rare coin collection. She has 28 coins in one bag and 35 coins in another. She gifts her friend 10 coins from the second bag. Write an expression for the number of coins left with Hira. This can be expressed by 28 + (35 – 10). We know that this is the same as 28 + (35 + (–10)). Since the terms can be added in any order, this expression can simply be written as 28 + 35 + (–10), or 28 + 35 – 10. Thus, 28 + (35 – 10) = 28 + 35 – 10 = 53. When the brackets are NOT preceded by a negative sign, the terms within them do not change their signs upon removing the brackets.

Thus, 10 × 98 +3 × 98 = (10 + 3) × 98. Writing this equality the other way, we get (10 + 3) 98 = 10 × 98 + 3 × 98. Swapping the numbers in the products above, this property can be seen in the following form: 98 × 10 + 9 × 83 = 98 (10 + 3), and 98 (10 + 3) = 98 × 10 + 98 × 3. Similarly, let us consider the expression 14 × 10 – 6 × 10.

Choose a number and create ten different expressions having that value. • We have been reading and evaluating simple expressions for quite some time now. Here we started by revising the meaning of some simple expressions and their values. • We learnt how to compare certain expressions through reasoning instead of bluntly evaluating them. • To help read and evaluate complex expressions without confusion, we use terms and brackets. • When an expression is written as a sum of terms, changing the order of the terms or grouping the terms does not change the value of the expression. This is because the “commutative property of addition” and the “associative property of addition”, respectively. • To evaluate expressions within brackets, we saw that when we remove brackets preceded by a negative sign, the terms within the bracket change their sign. • We also learnt about the “distributive property” — multiplying a number with an expression inside brackets is equal to the multiplying the number with each term in the bracket. SUMMARY Arithmetic Expressions 45 Expression Engineer! Using three 3’s along with the four operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) and brackets as needed we can create several expressions. For example, (3 + 3)/3 = 2, 3 + 3 – 3 = 3, 3 × 3 + 3 = 12, and so on. Using four 4’s, create expressions to get all values from 1 to 20.

What other similar interesting questions can you ask? 3.1 The Need for Smaller Units Sonu’s mother was fixing a toy. She was trying to join two pieces with the help of a screw. Sonu was watching his mother with great curiosity. His mother was unable to join the pieces. Sonu asked why. His mother said that the screw was not of the right size. She brought another screw from the box and was able to fix the toy. The two screws looked the same to Sonu. But when he observed them closely, he saw they were of slightly different lengths. Sonu was fascinated by how such a small difference in lengths could matter so much. He was curious to know the difference in lengths. He was also curious to know how little the difference was because the screws looked nearly the same. In the following figure, screws are placed above a scale. Measure them and write their length in the space provided. A PEEK BEYOND THE POINT 3 A Peek Beyond the Point Which scale helped you measure the length of the screws accurately? Why?

For a whole number written in the Indian place value system — for example, 281 — the place value of 2 is hundreds (100), that of 8 is tens (10), and that of 4 is one (1). Each place value is 10 times bigger than the one immediately to its right. Equivalently, each place value is 10 times smaller than the one immediately to its left: 10 ones make 1 ten, 10 tens make 1 hundred, 10 hundreds make 1 thousand, and so on. 10,000 1000 100 10 1 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 × 10 ÷ 10 In order to extend this system of writing numbers to quantities smaller than one, we divide one into 10 equal parts.

We can ask similar questions about fractional parts: (a) How many thousandths make one unit? (b) How many thousandths make one tenth? (c) How many thousandths make one hundredth? (d) How many tenths make one ten? (e) How many hundredths make one ten? Make a few more questions of this kind and answer them. Notation, Writing and Reading of Numbers We have been writing numbers in a particular way, say 456, instead of writing them as 4 × 100 (4 hundreds) + 5 × 10 (5 tens) + 6 × 1 (6 ones). Similarly, can we skip writing tenths and hundredths? Can the quantity 4 2 10 be written as 42 (skipping the 1 10 in 2 × 1 10) ? If yes, how would we know if 42 means 4 tens and 2 units or it means 4 units and 2 tenths? Similarly, 705 could mean: (a) 7 hundreds, and 0 tens and 5"}

To identify the place value where integers end and the fractional parts start, we use a point or period (‘.’) as a separator, called a decimal point. The above quantities in decimal notation are then: Quantity Decimal Notation 7 hundreds and 5 ones (700 + 0 + 5) 705 7 tens and 5 tenths (70 + 0 + 5 10) 70.5 7 units and 5 hundredths (7 + 0 + 5 100) 7.05 These numbers, when shown through place value, are as follows: Decimal number Hundreds Tens Units Tenths Hundredths 705 7 × 100 0 × 10 5 × 1 70.5 7 × 10 0 × 1 5 × 1 10 7.05 7 × 1 0 × 1 10 5 × 1 100 × 10 × 1 × 1 10 × 1 100 number of tens number of units number of"}

Just as 705 means 7 × 100 + 5 × 1, the number 70.5 means 7 × 10 + 5 × 1 10 , and 7.05 means 7 × 1 +5 × 1 100. We have seen how to write numbers using the decimal point (‘.’). But how do we read/say these numbers? We know that 705 is read as seven hundred and five. 70.5 is read as seventy point five, short for seventy and five-tenths. 7.05 is read as seven point zero five, short for seven and five hundredths. 0.274 is read as zero point two seven four. We don’t read it as zero point two hundred and seventy four as 0.274 means 2 one-tenths and 7 one-hundredths and 4 one-thousandths. Make a place value table similar to the one above.

Here are some actual incidents in which such errors caused major issues. Math Talk Try This 76 A Peek Beyond the Point • In 2013, the finance office of Amsterdam City Council (Netherlands) mistakenly sent out €188 million in housing benefits instead of the intended €1.8 million due to a programming error that processed payments in euro cents instead of euros.

The ground staff miscalculated the fuel, loading 22,300 pounds instead of kilograms—about half of what was needed (1 pound ~ 0.453 kg). The plane ran out of fuel mid-air, forcing the pilots to make an emergency landing at an abandoned airfield. Fortunately, everyone survived.

For example, reading 0.05 mg as 0.5 mg can lead to using a medicine 10 times more than the prescribed quantity. It is therefore important to pay attention to units and the location of the decimal point. Deceptive Decimal Notation Sarayu gets a message: “The bus will reach the station 4.5 hours post noon.” When will the bus reach the station: 4:05 p.m., 4:50 p.m., 4:25 p.m.? None of these! Here, 0.5 hours means splitting an hour into 10 equal parts and taking 5 parts out of it. Each part will be 6 minutes (60 minutes/10) long. 5 such parts make 30 minutes. So, the bus will reach the station at 4:30. Here is a short-story of a decimal mishap: A girl measures the width of an opening as 2 ft 5 inches but conveys to the carpenter to make a door 2.5 ft wide. The carpenter makes a door of width 2 ft 6 inches (since 1 ft = 12 inches, 0.5 ft = 6 inches), and it wouldn’t close fully. I said the door’s width should be 2.5 ft. It is 2.5 ft! You can verify. 77 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 If you watch cricket, you might have noticed decimal-looking numbers like ‘Overs left: 5.5’. Does this mean 5 overs and 5 balls or 5 overs and 3 balls?

A Pinch of History – Decimal Notation Over Time Decimal fractions (i.e., fractions with denominators like 1 10 , 1 100 , 1 1000 , and so on) are used in the works of a number of ancient Indian astronomers and mathematicians, including in the important 8th century works of Śhrīdharāchārya on arithmetic and algebra. Decimal notation, in essentially its modern form, was described in detail in Kitāb al-Fuṣūl fī al-Ḥisāb al Hindī (The Book of Chapters on Indian Arithmetic) by Abūl Ḥassan al-Uqlīdisī, an Arab mathematician, in around 950 CE. He represented the number 0.059375 as 0ˈ 059375. In the 15th century, to separate whole numbers from fractional parts, a number of different notations were used: • a vertical mark on the last digit of the whole number part (as shown above), • use of different colours and • a numerical superscript giving the number of fractional decimal places (0.36 would be written as 36 2 ). In the 16th century, John Napier, a Scottish mathematician, and Christopher Clavius, a German mathematician, used the point/period (‘.’) to separate the whole number and the fractional parts, while François Viète, a French mathematician, used the comma (‘,’) instead. Currently, several countries use the comma to separate the integer part and the fractional part. In these countries, the number 1,000.5 is written as 1 000,5 (space as a thousand separator).

SUMMARY Try This 80 4.1 The Notion of Letter-Numbers In this chapter we shall look at a concise way of expressing mathematical relations and patterns. We shall see how this helps us in thinking about these relationships and patterns, and in explaining why they may hold true. Example 1: Shabnam is 3 years older than Aftab. When Aftab’s age 10 years, Shabnam’s age will be 13 years. Now Aftab’s age is 18 years, what will Shabnam’s age be? _______ Given Aftab’s age, how will you find out Shabnam’s age? Easy: We add 3 to Aftab’s age to get Shabnam’s age. Can we write this as an expression? Shabnam’s age is 3 years more than Aftab’s. In short, this can be written as: Shabnam’s age = Aftab’s age + 3. Such mathematical relations are generally represented in a shorthand form. In the relation above, instead of writing the phrase ‘Aftab’s Age’, the convention is to use a convenient symbol. Usually, letters or short phrases are used for this purpose. Let us say we use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age (we could have used any other letter), and s to denote Shabnam’s age. Then the expression to find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as s = a + 3. If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age? Expression for Shabnam’s age 4 + 3 10"}

Then the expression to find Shabnam’s age will be a + 3, which can be written as s = a + 3. If a is 23 (Aftab’s age in years), then what is Shabnam’s age? Expression for Shabnam’s age 4 + 3 10 + 3 23 + 3 ? + 3 a + 3 Aftab’s age 4 10 23 ? a Fig. 4.1 EXPRESSIONS USING LETTER- NUMBERS 4 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Replacing a by 23 in the expression a + 3, we get, s = 23 + 3 = 26 years. Letters such as a and s that are used to represent numbers are called letter-numbers. Mathematical expressions containing letter-numbers, such as the expression a + 3, are called algebraic expressions. Given the age of Shabnam, write an expression to find Aftab’s age. We know that Aftab is 3 years younger than Shabnam. So, Aftab’s age will be 3 less than Shabnam’s. This can be described as Aftab’s age = Shabnam’s age – 3. If we again use the letter a to denote Aftab’s age and the letter s to denote Shabnam’s age, then the algebraic expression would be: a = s – 3, meaning 3 less than s. Use this expression to find Aftab’s age if Shabnam’s age is 20. Example 2: Parthiv is making matchstick patterns. He repeatedly places Ls next to each other. Each L has two matchsticks as shown in Figure 4.2. Fig. 4.2 How many matchsticks are needed to make 5 Ls? It will be 5 × 2. How many matchsticks are needed to make 7 Ls? It will be 7 × 2. How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2. \u0007Now, what is the relation between the number"}

How many matchsticks are needed to make 45 Ls? It will be 45 × 2. \u0007Now, what is the relation between the number of Ls and the number of sticks? First, let us describe the relationship or the pattern here. Every L needs 2 matchsticks. So the number of matchsticks needed will be 2 times the number of L’s. This can be written as: Number of matchsticks = 2 × Number of L’s Now, we can use any letter to denote the number of L’s. Let’s use n. The algebraic expression for the number of matchsticks will be: 2 × n. This expression tells us how many matchsticks are needed to make n L’s. To find the number of matchsticks, we just replace n by the number of L. Example 3: Ketaki prepares and supplies coconut-jaggery laddus. The price of a coconut is ₹35 and the price of 1 kg jaggery is ₹60. 82 Expressions Using Letter-Numbers How much should she pay if she buys 10 coconuts and 5 kg jaggery? Cost of 10 coconuts = 10 × ₹35 Cost of 5 kg jaggery = 5 × ₹60 Total cost = 10 × ₹35 + 5 × ₹60 = ₹350 + ₹300 = ₹650. How much should she pay if she buys 8 coconuts and 9 kg jaggery? Write an algebraic expression to find the total amount to be paid for a given number of coconuts and quantity of jaggery. Let us identify the relationships and then write the expressions.

Notice that for different values of ‘c’ and ‘j’, the value of the expression also changes.

In a calendar month, if any 2 × 3 grid full of dates is chosen as shown in the picture, write expressions for the dates in the blank cells if the bottom middle cell has date ‘w’. 4.2 Revisiting Arithmetic Expressions We learnt to write expressions as sums of terms and it became easy for us to read arithmetic expressions. Many times they could have been read in multiple ways and it was confusing. We used swapping (adding two numbers in any order) and grouping (adding numbers by grouping them conveniently) to find easy ways of evaluating expressions. Swapping and grouping terms does not change the value of the expression. We also learnt to use brackets in expressions, including brackets with a negative sign outside. We learnt the distributive property (multiple of a sum is the same as sum of multiples). Let us revise these concepts and find the values of the following expressions: 1. 23 – 10 × 2 2. 83 + 28 – 13 + 32 3. 34 – 14 + 20 4. 42 + 15 – (8 – 7) 5. 68 – (18 + 13) 6. 7 × 4 + 9 × 6 7. 20 + 8 × (16 – 6) Let us evaluate the first expression, 23 – 10 × 2.

All the terms of this expression are numbers. If we notice the terms, we find that it will be easier to evaluate if we swap and group the terms. 83 + 28 – 13 + 32 = Let us now look at the fifth expression. It has brackets with a negative sign outside. This can be evaluated in two ways — by solving the bracket first (like the solution on the left side) or by removing the brackets appropriately (as on the right side). Now, find the values of the other arithmetic expressions. Algebraic expressions also take number values when the letter- numbers they contain are replaced by numbers. In Example 1, for finding Shabnam’s age when Aftab is 23 years old, we replaced the letter-number a in the expression a + 3 by 23, and it took the value 26. 4.3 \u0007Omission of the Multiplication Symbol in Algebraic Expressions Look at this number sequence: 4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, ...

Let us now find an expression to find the perimeter of a rectangle. 1 If a = – 4, then 10 – a = 6. 2 If d = 6, then 3d = 36. 3 If s = 7, then 3s – 2 = 15. 4 If r = 8, then 2r + 1 = 29. 5 If j = 5, then 2j = 10. 6 If m = –6, then 3 (m + 1) = 19. 7 If f = 3, g = 1 then 2f – 2g = 2. 8 If t = 4, b = 3 then 2t + b = 24. 9 If h = 5, n = 6 then h – (3 – n) = 4. 87 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 As in the previous cases, we will first describe how to get the perimeter when the length and the breadth of the rectangle are known: Find the sum of length + breadth + length + breadth. Let us use the letter-numbers l and b in place of length and breadth respectively. Let p denote the perimeter of the rectangle. Then we have p = l + b + l + b As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an expression can be added in any order. Hence the"}

Then we have p = l + b + l + b As we know, these represent numbers, and so the terms of an expression can be added in any order. Hence the above expression can be written as: = l + l + b + b As l + l = 2 × l = 2l, and b + b = 2 × b = 2b, we have p = 2l + 2b. Notice that the initial expression (l + b + l + b) and the final expression (2l + 2b) that we got for the perimeter look different. However, they are equal since the expression was obtained from the initial one by applying the same rules and operations we do for numbers; they are equal in the sense that they both take the same values when letter- numbers are replaced by numbers. For example, if we assign l = 3, b = 4, we get l + b + l + b = 3 + 4 + 3 + 4 = 14, and 2l + 2b = 2 × 3 + 2 × 4 = 14. We call the expression 2l + 2b the simplified form of l + b + l + b. Let us see some more examples of simplification. Example 5: Here is a table showing the number of pencils and erasers sold in a shop. The price per pencil is c, and the price per eraser is d.

Day 1 Day 2 Day 3 Pencils (Price ‘c’) 5 3 10 Erasers (Price ‘d’) 4 6 1 Let us first find the money earned by the sale of pencils. The money earned by selling pencils on Day 1 is 5c. Similarly, the money earned by selling pencils on Day 2 is _____, and Day 3 is ______. The total money earned by the sale of pencils is 5c + 3c + 10c. Can we simplify this expression further and reduce the number of terms? 88 Expressions Using Letter-Numbers The expression means 5 times c is added to 3 times c is added to 10 times c. So in total, the letter-number c is added (5 + 3 + 10) times. This is what we have seen as the distributive property of numbers. Thus, 5 × c + 3 × c + 10 × c = (5 + 3 + 10) × c (5 + 3 + 10) × c can be simplified to 18 × c = 18c. If c = ₹50, find the total amount earned by the scale of pencils. Write the expression for the total money earned by selling erasers. Then, simplify the expression. The expression for the total money earned by selling pencils and erasers during these three days is 18c + 11d. Can the expression 18c + 11d be simplified further? There is no way of further simplifying this expression as it contains different letter-numbers. It is in its simplest form.

Write an expression describing the area of the bigger rectangle. The areas of the smaller rectangles are 4v sq. units and 3v sq. units. The area of the bigger rectangle can be found in two ways: (i) by directly using its side lengths v and (4 + 3), or (ii) by adding the areas of the smaller rectangles. The first way gives 7v, and the second way gives 4v + 3v. We know that they are equal: 4v + 3v = 7v, and this is the required expression for the area of the bigger rectangle. As earlier, a big rectangle is split into two smaller rectangles as shown below. Write an expression to find the area of the rectangle AEFD.

Example 7: A shop rents out chairs and tables for a day’s use. To rent them, one has to first pay the following amount per piece. When the furniture is returned, the shopkeeper pays back some amount as follows. Write an expression for the total number of rupees paid if x chairs and y tables are rented. For x chairs and y tables, let us find the total amount paid at the beginning and the amount one gets back after returning the furniture. Describe the procedure to get these amounts. The total amount in rupees paid at the beginning is 40x + 75y, and the total amount returned is 6x + 10y. So, the total amount paid = (40x + 75y) – (6x + 10y). Can we simplify this expression?

So the nth occurrence of Design C will be at position 3n. Similarly, find the formula that gives the position where the other Designs appear for the nth time. The positions where B occurs are 2, 5, 8, 11, 14, and so on. We can see that the position of the nth appearance of Design B is one less than the position at which Design C appears for the nth time.

Let us consider a 2 × 2 square. Its top left number can be any number. Let us call it ‘a’. Given that we know the top left number, how do we find the other numbers in this 2 × 2 square? As we have been doing, first let us describe the other numbers in words. a ? ? ? 12 13 19 20 98 Expressions Using Letter-Numbers • the number to the right of ‘a’ will be 1 more than it. • the number below ‘a’ will be 7 more than it. • the number diagonal to ‘a’ will be 8 more than it. So the other numbers in the 2 × 2 square can be represented as shown in the grid. Let us find the diagonal sums; a + (a + 8), and (a + 1) + (a + 7). Let us simplify them. Since the terms can be added in any order, the brackets can be opened. a + (a + 8) = a + a + 8 = 2a + 8 (a + 1) + (a + 7) = a + 1 + a + 7 = a + a + 1 + 7 = 2a + 8 We see that both diagonal sums are equal to 2a + 8 (8 more than 2 times a).

Now we can find the number of matchsticks at any step quickly. You might have already noticed that there is a 2 in the first step also, 3 = 1 + 2. Using this, the expression we get is 2y + 1.

Fig. 5.1 In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between lines on a plane surface. The table top, your piece of paper, the blackboard, and the bulletin board are all examples of plane surfaces. Let us observe a pair of lines that meet each other. You will notice that they meet at a point. When a pair of lines meet each other at a point on a plane surface, we say that the lines intersect each other. Let us observe what happens when two lines intersect. How many angles do they form? In Fig. 5.2, where line l intersects line m, we can see that four angles are formed. Parallel and Intersecting Lines m a b l c d Fig. 5.2 Can two straight lines intersect at more than one point? Activity 1 Draw two lines on a plain sheet of paper so that they intersect. Measure the four angles formed with a protractor. Draw four such pairs of intersecting lines and measure the angles formed at the points of intersection. What patterns do you observe among these angles? In Fig. 5.2, if ∠a is 120°, can you figure out the measurements of ∠b, ∠c and ∠d, without drawing and measuring them? We know that ∠a and ∠b together measure 180°, because when they are combined, they form a straight angle which measures 180°. So, if ∠a is 120°, then ∠b must be 60°. Similarly, ∠b and ∠c together measure 180°. So, if ∠b is 60°, then ∠c must be 120°. And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, then ∠d must be 60°.

And ∠c and ∠d together measure 180°. So, if ∠c is 120°, then ∠d must be 60°. Therefore, in Fig. 5.2, ∠a and ∠c measure 120°, and ∠b and ∠d measure 60°. When two lines intersect each other and form four angles, labelled a, b, c and d, as in Fig. 5.2, then ∠a and ∠c are equal, and ∠b and ∠d are equal! Is this always true for any pair of intersecting lines? Check this for different measures of ∠a. Using these measurements, can you reason whether this property holds true for any measure of ∠a? We can generalise our reasoning for Fig. 5.2, without assuming the values of ∠a. \u0007Since straight angles measure 180°, we must have ∠a + ∠b = ∠a + ∠d = 180°. Hence, ∠b and ∠d are always equal. Similarly, ∠b + ∠a = ∠b + ∠c = 180°, so ∠a and ∠c must be equal. Adjacent angles, like ∠a and ∠b, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called linear pairs. Linear pairs always add up to 180°. 107 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Opposite angles, like ∠b and ∠d, formed by two lines intersecting each other, are called vertically opposite angles. Vertically opposite angles are always equal to each other. From the above reasoning, we conclude that whenever two lines intersect, vertically opposite angles are equal. Such a justification is called a proof in mathematics.

Or, when you measure vertically opposite angles they may be unequal sometimes. What are the reasons for this? There could be different reasons: • Measurement errors because of improper use of measuring instruments — in this case, a protractor • Variation in the thickness of the lines drawn. The “ideal” line in geometry does not have any thickness! But it is not possible for us to draw lines without any thickness In geometry, we create ideal versions of “lines” and other shapes we see around us, and analyse the relationships between them. For example, we know that the angle formed by a straight line is 180°. So, if another line divides this angle into two parts, both parts should add up to 180°. We arrive at this simply through reasoning and not by measurement. When we measure, it might not be exactly so, for the reasons mentioned above. Still the measurements come out very close to what we predict, because of which geometry finds widespread application in different disciplines such as physics, art, engineering and architecture. 5.2 Perpendicular Lines Can you draw a pair of intersecting lines such that all four angles are equal?

Perpendicular lines are a pair of lines which intersect each other at right angles (90°). In Fig. 5.4, we can say that lines l and m are perpendicular to each other. 5.3 Between Lines Observe Fig. 5.5 and describe the way the line segments meet or cross each other in each case, with appropriate mathematical words (a point, an endpoint, the midpoint, meet, intersect) and the degree measure of each angle.

Such lines are called parallel lines. Parallel lines are a pair of lines that lie on the same plane, and do not meet however far we extend them at both ends.

Note to the Teacher: It is easier to draw vertical and horizontal lines and the ones inclined at 45° (on rectangular dot sheets), but drawing a line parallel to one which has a different orientation is slightly harder. Let students use their intuition for this. From previous exercises we observed that sometimes it is difficult to be sure whether two lines are parallel. To determine this we use the idea of transversals. a c b Fig. 5.13 114 Parallel and Intersecting Lines 5.5 Transversals We saw what happens when two lines intersect in different ways.

What about five different angles — 6, 5, 4, 3 and 2? In Fig. 5.14, since ∠1 and ∠3 are vertically opposite angles, they are equal. Are there other pairs of vertically opposite angles? We can see that there are a total of four pairs of vertically opposite angles and in each pair, the angles are equal to each other. Thus, when a transversal intersects two lines, it forms eight angles with a maximum of four distinct angle measures. 5.6 Corresponding Angles In Fig. 5.14, we notice that the transversal t forms two sets of angles — one with line l and another with line m. There are angles in the first set that correspond to angles in the second set based on their position. ∠1 and ∠5 are called corresponding angles. Similarly, ∠2 and ∠6, ∠3 and ∠7, ∠4 and ∠8 are the corresponding angles formed when transversal t intersects lines l and m.

Note to the Teacher: Students should be encouraged to check the equality of corresponding angles both by using the tracing method and using protractors to measure the angles. Pay attention to the language used to make the relationship between corresponding angles and parallel lines. Equality of corresponding angles is both necessary and sufficient for the pair of lines to be parallel to each other. Figure it Out Can you draw a line parallel to l, that goes through point A?

Activity 6 In Fig. 5.25, if ∠f is 120° what is the measure of its alternate angle ∠d? We can find the measure of ∠d if we know ∠b because they are vertically opposite angles. Remember, vertically opposite angles are equal. What is the measure of ∠b? It is 120° because it is the corresponding angle of ∠f. So, ∠d also measures 120°. In fact, ∠f = ∠b irrespective of the measure of ∠f. Why? Because ∠b is the corresponding angle of ∠f. Similarly, ∠b = ∠d irrespective of the measure of ∠b. Why? Because ∠d is the vertically opposite angle of ∠b. So, it must always be the case that ∠f = ∠d Using our understanding of corresponding angles without any measurements, we have justified that alternate angles are always equal.

Since ∠ADC is given as 60°, ∠BCD = 120° Similarly, we find ∠ABC = 60°. Therefore, in Fig. 5.29, ∠CAB = 55°, ∠ABC = 60°, and ∠BCD = 120°. 122 Parallel and Intersecting Lines Figure it Out 1.

The vertically opposite angles are equal and the linear pairs add up to 180°. • When two lines intersect and the angles formed are 90° (i.e., all four angles are equal), the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other. • When two lines never intersect on a plane, they are called parallel lines. • When a line t intersects another pair of lines, it is called a transversal and it forms 2 sets of 4 angles. Each of the 4 angles in the first set has a corresponding angle in the second set. • When a transversal intersects a pair of parallel lines, the corresponding angles are equal.

Now, they call out numbers using a different rule. What do you think these numbers mean? The children rearrange themselves and each one says a number based on the new arrangement. Could you figure out what these numbers convey? Observe and try to find out. NUMBER PLAY 6 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 The rule is — each child calls out the number of children in front of them who are taller than them.

Now, add a few odd numbers together. What kind of number do you get? Does it matter how many odd numbers are added? Odd numbers can not be arranged in pairs. An odd number is one more than a collection of pairs. Some odd numbers are shown below: 129 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Can we also think of an odd number as one less than a collection of pairs? This figure shows that the sum of two odd numbers must always be even! This along with the other figures here are more examples of a proof!

No. Explore what happens to the sum of (a) 4 odd numbers, (b) 5 odd numbers, and (c) 6 odd numbers. Let us go back to the puzzle Kishor was trying to solve. There are 5 empty boxes. That means he has an odd number of boxes. All the number cards contain odd numbers. They should add to 30, which is an even number.

Today they are celebrating their birthday. Maria exclaims that the sum of their ages is 112. Is this possible? Why or why not? As they were born one year apart, their ages will be (two) consecutive numbers. Can their ages be 51 and 52? 51 + 52 = 103. Try some other consecutive numbers and see if their sum is 112. The counting numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... alternate between even and odd numbers. In any two consecutive numbers, one will always be even and the other will always be odd! What would be the resulting sum of an even number and an odd number? We can see that their sum can’t be arranged in pairs and thus will be an odd number. 130 Number Play Since 112 is an even number, and Martin’s and Maria’s ages are consecutive numbers, they cannot add up to 112. We use the word parity to denote the property of being even or odd. For instance, the parity of the sum of any two consecutive numbers is odd. Similarly, the parity of the sum of any two odd numbers is even. Figure it Out 1.

We see that at any position, the value at the odd number sequence is one less than that in the even number sequence. Thus, the 100th odd number is 200 – 1 = 199. Write a formula to find the nth odd number. Let us first describe the method that we have learnt to find the odd number at a given position: (a) Find the even number at that position. This is 2 times the position number. (b) Then subtract 1 from the even number. Writing this in expressions, we get (a) 2n (b) 2n – 1 Thus, 2n is the formula that gives the nth even number, and 2n – 1 is the formula that gives the nth odd number. 6.3 Some Explorations in Grids Observe this 3 × 3 grid.

You might have realised that it is not possible to find a solution for this grid. Why is this the case? The smallest sum possible is 6 = 1 + 2 + 3. The largest sum possible is 24 = 9 + 8 + 7. Clearly, any number in a circle cannot be less than 6 or greater than 24. The grid has sums 5 and 26. Therefore, this is impossible! In the earlier grids which we solved, Kishor noticed that the sum of all the numbers in the circles was always 90. Also, Vidya observed that the sum of the circled numbers for all three rows, or for all three columns, was always 45. Check if this is true in the previous grids you have solved. Why should the row sums and column sums always add to 45? From this grid, we can see that all the row sums added together will be the same as the sum of the numbers 1 – 9. This can be seen for column sums as well. The sum of the numbers 1 – 9 is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 = 45. A square grid of numbers is called a magic square if each row, each column and each diagonal, add up to the same number. This number is called the magic sum. Diagonals are shown in the picture.

Trying to create a magic square by randomly filling the grid with numbers may be difficult! This is because there are a large number of ways of filling a 3 × 3 grid using the numbers 1 – 9 without repetition. In fact, it can be found that there are exactly 3,62,880 such ways. Surprisingly, the number of ways to fill in the grid can be found without listing all of them. We will see in later years how to do this. Instead, we should proceed systematically to make a magic square. For this, let us ask ourselves some questions. 1. What can the magic sum be? Can it be any number? 6 5 21 19 26 11 9 The 3 row sums added together gives 45!

We have seen that in a 3 × 3 grid with numbers 1 – 9, the total of row sums will always be 45. Since in a magic square the row sums are all equal, and they add up to 45, they have to be 15 each. Thus, we have the following observation. Observation 1: In a magic square made using the numbers 1 – 9, the magic sum must be 15. 2. What are the possible numbers that could occur at the centre of a magic square? Let us consider the possibilities one by one. Can the central number be 9?

The same issue will occur no matter where we place 8. So, 9 cannot be at the centre. Can the central number be 1? If yes, then 2 should come in one of the other squares. Here, we must have 2 + 1 + other number = 15. But this is not possible because we are only using the numbers 1 – 9. The same issue will occur no matter where we place 1. So, 1 cannot be at the centre, either. Using such reasoning, find out which other numbers 1 – 9 cannot occur at the centre. This exploration will lead us to the following interesting observation. Observation 2: The number occurring at the centre of a magic square, filled using 1 – 9, must be 5. Let us now see where the smallest number 1 and the largest number 9 should come in a magic square. Our second observation tells us that they will have to come in one of the boundary positions. Let us classify these positions into two categories: 8 9 1 2 5 135 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Can 1 occur in a corner position? For example, can it be placed as follows?

The turtle carried a 3 × 3 grid on its back, with the numbers 1 to 9 arranged in a magical pattern. Magic squares were studied in different parts of the world at different points of time including India, Japan, Central Asia, and Europe. Indian mathematicians have worked extensively on magic squares, describing general methods of constructing them. The work of Indian mathematicians was not just limited to 3 × 3 and 4 × 4 grids, which we considered above, but also extended to 5 × 5 and other larger square grids. We shall learn more about these in later grades. The occurrence of magic squares is not limited to scholarly mathematical works. They are found in many places in India. The picture to the right is of a 3 × 3 magic square found on a pillar in a temple in Palani, Tamil Nadu.

(Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers) is one of the most celebrated sequences in all of mathematics — it occurs throughout the world of Art, Science, and Mathematics. Even though these numbers are found very frequently in Science, it is remarkable that these numbers were first discovered in the context of Art (specifically, poetry)! The Virahāṅka–Fibonacci Numbers thus provide a beautiful illustration of the close links between Art, Science, and Mathematics. Discovery of the Virahāṅka Numbers The Virahāṅka numbers first came up thousands of years ago in the works of Sanskrit and Prakrit linguists in their study of poetry! In the poetry of many Indian languages, including, Prakrit, Sanskrit, Marathi, Malayalam, Tamil, and Telugu, each syllable is classified as either long or short. A long syllable is pronounced for a longer duration than a short syllable — in fact, for exactly twice as long. When singing such a poem, a short syllable lasts one beat of time, and a long syllable lasts two beats of time. This leads to numerous mathematical questions, which the ancient poets in these languages considered extensively.

How many ways did you find? (You should find 8 different ways!) Can you figure out the answer without listing down all the possibilities? Can you try it for n = 8? Here is a systematic way to write down all rhythms of short and long syllables having 5 beats. Write a ‘1+’ in front of all rhythms having 4 beats, and then a ‘2+’ in front of all rhythms having 3 beats. This gives us all the rhythms having 5 beats: 140 Number Play n = 5 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 1 + 1 + 2 + 1 1 + 2 + 1 + 1 1 + 2 + 2 2 + 1 + 1 + 1 2 + 1 + 2 2 + 2 + 1 Thus, there are 8 rhythms having 5 beats! The reason this method works is that every 5-beat rhythm must begin with either a ‘1+’ or a ‘2+’. If it begins with a ‘1+’, then the remaining numbers must give a 4-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. If it begins with a 2+, then the remaining number must give a 3-beat rhythm, and we can write all those down. Therefore, the number of 5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat"}

Therefore, the number of 5-beat rhythms is the number of 4-beat rhythms, plus the number of 3-beat rhythms. How many 6-beat rhythms are there? By the same reasoning, it will be the number of 5-beat rhythms plus the number of 4-beat rhythms, i.e., 8 + 5 = 13. Thus, there are 13 rhythms having 6 beats. Use the systematic method to write down all 6-beat rhythms, i.e., write 6 as the sum of 1’s and 2’s in all possible ways. Did you get 13 ways? This beautiful method for counting all the rhythms of short syllables and long syllables having any given number of beats was first given by the great Prakrit scholar Virahāṅka around the year 700 CE. He gave his method in the form of a Prakrit poem! For this reason, the sequence 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, . . . is known as the Virahāṅka sequence, and the numbers in the sequence are known as the Virahāṅka numbers. Virahāṅka was the first known person in history to explicitly consider these important numbers and write down the rule for their formation. Other scholars in India also considered these numbers in the same poetic context. Virahāṅka was inspired by earlier work of the legendary Sanskrit scholar Piṅgala, who lived around 300 BCE. After Virahāṅka, these numbers were also written about by Gopala (c. 1135 CE) and then by Hemachandra (c. 1150 CE).

In this case, the direct path is longer, which is absurd. Can such a triangle exist? No. Therefore, a triangle having sidelengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We are thus able to see without construction why a triangle for the set of lengths 10 cm, 15 cm and 30 cm cannot exist. We have been able to figure this out through spatial intuition and reasoning.

There are three such comparisons to be made. 3. For each set of lengths seen so far, you might have noticed that in at least two of the comparisons, the direct length was less than the sum of the other two (if not, check again!).

[Hint: Consider the direct lengths in the increasing order.] Given three sidelengths, what do we need to compare to check for the existence of a triangle? When each length is smaller than the sum of the other two, we say that the lengths satisfy the triangle inequality. For example, the set 3, 4, 5 satisfies the triangle inequality whereas, the set 10, 15, 30 does not satisfy the triangle inequality. We have seen that lengths such as 10, 15, 30 that do not satisfy the triangle inequality cannot be the sidelengths of a triangle. Try This 154 A Tale of Three Intersecting Lines Does a triangle exist with sidelengths 4 cm, 5 cm and 8 cm? This satisfies the triangle inequality: 8 < 4 + 5 = 9 Why do we not need to check the other two sides? This means that all the direct path lengths are less than the roundabout path lengths. Does this confirm the existence of a triangle? If one of the direct path lengths had been longer, we could have concluded that a triangle would surely not exist. But in this case, we can only say that a triangle may or may not exist. For the triangle to exist, the arcs that we construct to get the third vertex must intersect.

But are there other possibilities when the two circles are constructed? Let us visualise and study them. The following different cases can be conceived: A B Case 1: Circles touch each other A B Case 2: Circles do not intersect A B Case 3: Circles intersect each other internally Note that while constructing the circles, we take (a) the length of the base AB = longest of the given length (b) the radii of the circles to be the smaller two lengths. Which of the above-mentioned cases will lead to the formation of a triangle? Clearly, triangles are formed only when the circles intersect each other internally (Case 3). Let us study each of these cases by finding the relation between the radii (the smaller two lengths) and AB (longest length).

Isosceles triangles have two sides of equal length. Scalene triangles have sides of three different lengths. Can a similar classification be done based on equality of angles? Is there any relation between these two classifications? We will answer these questions in a later chapter. We used angle measures when classifying a triangle as a right- angled triangle. What are the other types of triangles based on angle measures? A classification of triangles based on their angle measures is acute- angled, right-angled and obtuse-angled triangles. We have already seen what a right-angled triangle is. It is a triangle with one right angle. Similarly, an obtuse-angled triangle has one obtuse angle. What could an acute-angled triangle be?

What happens when both numbers in the multiplication are fractions? Multiplying Two Fractions We know, that Aaron’s pet tortoise can walk only 1 4 km in 1 hour. How far can it walk in half an hour? Following our approach of using multiplication to solve such problems, we have, Distance covered in 1 2 hour = 1 2 × 1 4 km. Finding the product: Distance covered in 1 hour = 1 4 km. Therefore, the distance covered in 1 2 an hour is the length we get by dividing 1 4 into 2 equal parts. To find this, it is useful to represent fractions using the unit square to stand for a “whole”. Hour Distance 1 1 4 1 2 ? 1 4 Unit square as a “whole” 1 4 of the whole 177 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Now we divide this 1 4 into 2 equal parts. What do we get? What fraction of the whole is shaded? Since the whole is divided into 8 equal parts and one of the parts is shaded, we can say that 1 8 of the whole is shaded. So, the distance covered by the tortoise in half an hour is 1 8 km. This tells us that 1 2 × 1 4 = 1 8. If the tortoise walks faster and it can cover 2 5 km in 1 hour, how far will it walk in 3 4 of an hour? Distance covered = 3"}

(i) Distance in km covered in 1 4 of an hour = The quantity we get by dividing 2 5 into 4 equal parts. Taking the unit square as the whole, the shaded part (in Fig. 8.1) is a region we get when we divide 2 5 into 4 equal parts. How much of the whole is it? The whole is divided into 5 rows and 4 columns, creating 5 × 4 = 20 equal parts. Number of these parts shaded = 2. So, the distance covered in 1 4 of an hour = 2 20 .

It can be done as shown in the Fig. 8.2 with the yellow shaded region representing the fraction obtained by dividing 3 2 into 4 equal parts. What is its value?

The number of columns is the denominator of the multiplier, which is 12 in this case. Thus, the whole is divided into 18 × 12 equal parts. So, 1 18 × 1 12 = 1 (18×12) = 1 216.

Discussion In each of the division problems above, observe how we found the answer. Can we frame a rule that tells us how to divide two fractions? Let us consider the previous problem. In every division problem we have a dividend, divisor and quotient. The technique we have been using to get the quotient is: 1. First, find the number which gives 1 when multiplied by the divisor. We see that the resulting number is a fraction whose numerator is the divisor’s denominator and denominator is the divisor’s numerator. For the divisor 3 5 this fraction is 5 3. We call 5 3 the reciprocal of 3 5. When we multiply a fraction by its reciprocal, we get 1.

We then multiply the dividend with this reciprocal to get the quotient. Summarising, to divide two fractions: • Find the reciprocal of the divisor • Multiply this by the dividend to get the quotient. So, a b ÷ c d = d c × a b = d × a c × b. This can be rewritten as: a b ÷ c d = a b × d c = a × d b × c. As with methods and formulas for addition, subtraction, and multiplication of fractions that you learnt earlier, this method and formula for division of fractions, in this general form, was first explicitly stated by Brahmagupta in his Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta (628 CE). So, to evaluate, for example, 2 3 ÷ 3 5 using Brahmagupta’s formula above, we write: 2 3 ÷ 3 5 = 2 3 × 5 3 = 2 × 5 3 × 3 = 10 9 .

She used 1 4 litre of milk for this. How much milk is there in each cup of tea? Leena used 1 4 litres of milk in 5 cups of tea. So, in 1 cup of tea the volume of milk should be: 1 4 ÷ 5. Writing this as multiplication, we have: 5 × (milk per cup) = 1 4. We perform the division as follows as per Brahmagupta’s method: The reciprocal of 5 (the divisor) is 1 5. Multiplying this reciprocal by the dividend ( 1 4 ), we get 1 5 × 1 4 = 1 20. So, each cup of tea has 1 20 litre of milk. Example 4: Some of the oldest examples of working with non-unit fractions occur in humanity’s oldest geometry texts, the Śhulbasūtra. Here is an example from Baudhāyana’s Śhulbasūtra (c. 800 BCE).

Fig. 8.4 What fraction of area of the whole square does the shaded region occupy? There are different ways to solve this problem. Here is one of them: Let the area of the whole square be 1 square unit. We can see that the top right square (in Fig. 8.5), occupies 1 4 of the area of the whole square. Fig. 8.5 Area of red square = 1 4 square units. Math Talk Fig, 8.6 192 Working with Fractions Let us look at this red square. The area of the triangle inside it (coloured yellow) is half the area of the red square. So, the area of the yellow triangle = 1 2 × 1 4 = 1 8 square units. What fraction of this yellow triangle is shaded? The shaded region occupies 3 4 of the area of the yellow triangle. Are you able to see why? The area of shaded part = 3 4 × 1 8 = 3 32 square units. Thus, the shaded region occupies 3 32 of the area of the whole square. In each of the figures given below, find the fraction of the big square that the shaded region occupies.

The tale says that 1 dramma was equivalent to 1280 cowrie shells. Let’s see what fraction of a dramma the person gave: ( 1 2 × 2 3 × 3 4 × 1 5 × 1 16 × 1 4) th part of a dramma. 193 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 Evaluating it gives 6 7680 . Upon simplifying to its lowest form, we get 6 7680 = 1 1280. So, one cowrie shell was given to the beggar. You can see in the answer Bhāskarāchārya’s humour! The miser had given the beggar only one coin of the least value (cowrie). Around the 12th century, several types of coins were in use in different kingdoms of the Indian subcontinent. Most commonly used were gold coins (called dinars/gadyanas and hunas), silver coins (called drammas/tankas), copper coins (called kasus/panas and mashakas), and cowrie shells. The exact conversion rates between these coins varied depending on the region, time period, economic conditions, weights of coins and their purity.

Copper coins had low-value and were used in smaller transactions. Cowrie shells were the lowest denomination and were used in very small transactions and as change. If we assume 1 gold dinar = 12 silver drammas, 1 silver dramma = 4 copper panas, 1 copper pana = 6 mashakas, and 1 pana = 30 cowrie shells, 1 copper pana = 1 48 gold dinar ( 1 12 × 1 4) 1 cowrie shell =____ copper panas 1 cowrie shell =____ gold dinar. A Pinch of History As you have seen, fractions are an important type of number, playing a critical role in a variety of everyday problems that involve sharing and dividing quantities equally. The general notion of non-unit fractions as we use them today — equipped with the arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division — developed largely in India. The ancient Indian geometry texts called the Śhulbasūtra — which go back as far as 800 BCE, and were concerned with the construction of fire altars for rituals — used general non-unit fractions extensively, including performing division of such fractions as we saw in Example 3. Fractions even became commonplace in the popular culture of India as far back as 150 BCE, as evidenced by an offhand reference to the reduction of fractions to lowest terms in the philosophical work of the revered Jain scholar Umasvati. 194 Working with Fractions General rules for performing arithmetic operations on fractions — in essentially the modern form"}

We have already seen his methods for adding and subtracting general fractions. For multiplying general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote: “Multiplication of two or more fractions is obtained by taking the product of the numerators divided by the product of the denominators.” (Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta, Verse 12.1.3) That is, a b × c d = a × c b × d . For division of general fractions, Brahmagupta wrote: “The division of fractions is performed by interchanging the numerator and denominator of the divisor; the numerator of the dividend is then multiplied by the (new) numerator, and the denominator by the (new) denominator.” Bhāskara II in his book Līlāvatī in 1150 CE clarifies Brahmagupta‘s statement further in terms of the notion of reciprocal: “Division of one fraction by another is equivalent to multiplication of the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second.” (Līlāvatī, Verse 2.3.40) Both of these verses are equivalent to the formula: a b ÷ c d = a b ×d c = a × d b × c . Bhāskara I, in his 629 CE commentary Āryabhaṭīyabhāṣhya on Aryabhata’s 499 CE work, described the geometric interpretation of multiplication of fractions (that we saw earlier) in terms of the division of a square into rectangles via equal divisions along the length and breadth.

The Indian theory of fractions and arithmetic operations on them was transmitted to, and its usage developed further, by Arab and African mathematicians such as al-Hassâr (c. 1192 CE) of Morocco. The theory was then transmitted to Europe via the Arabs over the next few Bhāskara I’s visual explanation that 1 5 x 1 4 = 1 20 1 20 1 5 1 4 195 Ganita Prakash | Grade 7 centuries, and came into general use in Europe in only around the 17th century, after which it spread worldwide.

By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It endeavours to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development. Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks will play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that will strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks.

By incorporating hands-on activities, the textbook engages students in an integrated approach, promoting reflection and group discussions. The textbook emphasises creativity and innovation, positioning students as active learners. Additionally, the adopted pedagogy encourages critical thinking, reasoning, and decision-making. The textbook provides ample opportunities for peer learning, which enhances the overall learning experience for both teachers and students. The focus is on collaboration and active engagement through student-centred approach to education. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani Director New Delhi \b National Council of Educational March 2025 \b Research and Training About this Book We hope you enjoyed exploring the wonderful world of science in Grade 6, guided by the textbook Curiosity.

You might still have more questions in science that you wish to explore! The Grade 7 textbook, the second in the Curiosity series picks up where we left off in Grade 6, continuing this exciting journey and helping you explore even more questions that you may wonder about. The Grade 7 textbook has been carefully crafted in alignment with the recommendations of the National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 and the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023. The textbook has been designed to meet curricular goals, covering key scientific concepts like matter, the physical and living world, health, hygiene, and the connection between science, technology and society. Like the Grade 6 textbook, this textbook also focuses on the nature of science and its processes. Each chapter includes creative activities, thought-provoking questions, and helpful illustrations. The textbook combines concepts from biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science, while weaving in cross-cutting themes like value education, inclusive education, environmental education, and the Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). The goal is to encourage hands- on learning rather than rote memorisation. Through this approach, the Curiosity series aims to help learners think critically and become responsible members of society. Curiosity, Textbook of Science for Grade 7, has twelve chapters. Chapter 1, titled ‘The Ever-Evolving World of Science’, gives an overview of the ideas covered in the book and aims to get the readers excited about learning more about science. It develops a thread connecting all other chapters, showing how they are all linked together. It also highlights that science is primarily a way of thinking, observing, asking questions, and discovering by doing. It is a process rather than a compilation of facts. This"}

It also highlights that science is primarily a way of thinking, observing, asking questions, and discovering by doing. It is a process rather than a compilation of facts. This fun introductory chapter is meant to excite the students and is non-evaluative. The chapters start with real-life situations to grab the students’ attention and to help them relate with their previous knowledge. The activities in the book are designed to give learners hands-on and minds-on experiences. These activities are inclusive and encourage working together to promote collaborative learning. After each activity, there are questions to help learners check their understanding and see how much they have learnt. We hope the questions make the students think deeply, reflect, and analyse ideas critically to arrive at a conclusion. vi vi To sustain the readers’ interest, some challenging ideas, additional information, interesting facts, and other engaging materials are presented in various boxes. Fascinating Facts The ‘Dive Deeper’ boxes contain advanced concepts that lead to questions for in-depth exploration of a topic.

This again, is not just a textbook with facts — it is an invitation to question, to perform experiments, and to explore, as we try to understand the beautiful world we live in. The world of science covers everything — small and large, near and far. We may be looking at tiny cells inside a leaf, or the movement of the sun and the stars.

We may be testing out the materials around us at home, or discussing how water ﬂ ows underground. As you go through the chapters in this book, you will start new adventures that challenge your thinking, expand your knowledge, and help you become an explorer, making small discoveries for yourself. Before we dive into our exciting journey, take a moment to observe something special about this book. Look at the page numbers — they follow the playful ﬂ ight of a butterﬂ y and the soaring of a paper plane! Just as a butterﬂ y ﬂ utters freely and a paper plane ﬂ ies into the sky, learning takes ﬂ ight when curiosity leads the way. Did you know that something as simple as a paper plane inspired real scientiﬁ c explorations of ﬂ ight? From early inventors studying bird wings to modern engineers designing aircraft, the dream of ﬂ ying started with simple observations and experiments. So, as you turn each page, let your imagination take ﬂ ight — exploring new ideas, discovering wonders, and reaching for the skies! Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 2 Exploration, of course, isn’t just about discovering new facts or learning about diﬀ erent things in nature. Science, as we said in Grade 6, is a process, so it is about a way of thinking that welcomes curiosity, asks questions, and is open to the unknown. In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have"}

In Grade 7, we will try to ask deeper questions: How do things work? Why do events happen the way they do? And what can we learn from the patterns that we see in nature? To do this, we have to step out of this book, step out of the classroom perhaps, and experience the world through activities and experiments. These are experiences that we hope will not just be interesting or exciting but also serve as stepping stones to a deeper understanding of the environment we live in and of our place on this planet. We believe that this will also help you to see science as an ongoing process of discovery. And not just about discovery alone, but also about responsibility. As young science explorers, you will soon see how human activities are linked to what happens in the natural world and are connected to the society we live in. You will, we hope, also see the role that science can play in addressing environmental challenges and help in creating a more sustainable world. But let’s get back into this book for now. You will read about topics in diﬀ erent ﬁ elds of science, from physics and chemistry to biology and earth sciences. While they might appear as diﬀ erent chapters, just as we had said in Grade 6, they are all interconnected. Scientiﬁ c ideas in one area often inspire discoveries in another, or at least allow us to ask questions in another area. So, let’s take a quick journey through our book for this year.

We will start by looking at the properties of materials around us, mostly the things we experience but perhaps never ask questions about — why are some fruits sour? What happens when we wash a haldi stain on our school uniform? The Ever-Evolving World of Science 3 We then move on and play with some electric batteries, lamps and wires to try to ﬁ nd other kinds of properties of materials. What kind of materials do we need to make a lamp glow? This will lead us to classifying materials based on their properties — and we will enter the world of metals and non-metals. We know from our experience that a torch battery runs out eventually, and can’t be used again. We’ll explore what kind of changes happen around us. Some changes can be reversed and others cannot be reversed. Batteries run out, ice melts into water, fruits ripen, rocks break into pebbles… what kind of changes are these? Some of these happen, or happen faster, when things are heated. We will look at how heat ﬂ ows — whether it is the melting of an ice cube in a glass, or the melting of a glacier. Water is, of course, everywhere, and with the heat from the Sun, it evaporates from the seas and falls as rain, perhaps trickling down into the ground, somewhere far away. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 4 However, it isn’t just changes in materials around us that we see, or the hidden changes in water that we do not see.

As we are growing, our bodies are changing as well. Especially around the middle-school years, our bodies are changing rapidly! Why? Not just us humans, there are life processes that are essential to all animals for their survival. To grow, we have to eat and breathe, blood has to circulate the nutrients from the food all over the body and so on. But why animals alone? Don’t plants also need food to grow? How do they get their food? Do they also breathe? How? Over the time that life has evolved on our planet Earth, it has ﬁ gured out how to do this in a beautiful and carefully balanced way. Ah, but what is time? The clock on the wall or a wrist watch tells us the time and how it passes. We get prepared to go to school in the morning and are ready to sleep at night but have you thought about how we measure time? And how fast does something happen? Long before the age of electric clocks and digital watches, early humans observed the shadows of objects in the Sun and used the position of the shadows to tell the time. Light and shadows are not just useful for shadow puppets or to tell the time. Naturally, light helps us see and today, we’ve developed a lot of ways to generate light (so we can read a book at night, even when the Sun doesn’t shine).

But, more importantly, asking questions about the nature The Ever-Evolving World of Science 5 of light has given us a very deep understanding of the universe we live in. While we’ll perhaps learn about it only later, light and shadows are not just limited to things around us at home. Even the Earth and the Moon can cast shadows, leading to the fascinating phenomena of eclipses. And of course, we have day and night that depend on receiving light from the Sun. To understand all of this, we need to know how the Earth rotates around its axis, how the Moon goes around the Earth, and the Earth around the Sun. And the consequences of these movements on life on our beautiful planet. While all this might have your head spinning, think about it. Isn’t it amazing that we humans can wonder about the wonderful world we live in? In the chapters that follow, you’ll also make simple observations and do fun experiments, and dive into topics that need careful thinking. Each chapter builds on what you already know and encourages you to ask questions, explore, do hands- on experiments, and think like a scientist! As you will ﬁ nd out, even those experiments that seem to conﬁ rm what we think will happen, might lead to some additional questions that might need more experiments and more questions. 1.1 Happy Exploring! g ppy p Activity 1.1: Question the Answer In school or during tests, you’re usually given questions and expected to ﬁ nd the answers.

But let’s turn that around! To think Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 6 like a scientist, it is equally important to ask interesting questions! Great scientists don’t just answer questions — they ask amazing ones! (Remember last year we had said, “To be a wise person, you must be a whys person”.) Look at the answers below. Your task is to come up with a curious, creative, and fun question or situations that could lead to these answers. There are never any wrong questions, so let your imagination run wild! Since such exercises might not be very familiar, here is an example to help you! Suppose the answer was ‘just make it half!’ — what all could this be a response to? Well, it could range from “How do we ensure getting equal shares of cake?” to “My essay is too long”, or “I can’t ﬁ t this in the envelope” or even “I cannot dance to such a long song”... all very diﬀ erent! So, let’s see what kind of creative questions you can ask! (Please ask a more interesting, and not obvious questions like “What is 32+10?”, or even “What is the answer to life, the universe, and everything?”) Answer: Because the cat’s teeth were crooked.

At the entry gate, siblings Ashwin and Keerthi were greeted with a white sheet of paper. They were curious to know why a white sheet of paper was given to them! A few steps ahead, there was a volunteer spraying a liquid on these sheets of paper. The siblings also got their white sheets sprayed. To their surprise, the words ‘Welcome to the Wonderful World of Science’ appeared on the papers the moment the liquid was sprayed (Fig. 2.1). They were excited and eager to know how this happened and the reason behind it. Their curiosity was partly satisﬁ ed at the ‘Colourful World of Substances’ stall. They saw many activities showing colour changes on mixing diﬀ erent substances. They decided to explore these changes further. Let us join them on this learning adventure.

How to prepare lime water? Do not confuse lime water with the word lime, which is a fruit similar to lemon. Lime water (solution of calcium hydroxide in water) can be easily prepared by mixing lime (chuna, i.e. calcium oxide) in water and leaving it undisturbed for some time, say an hour. Filter the liquid into another container and use it as lime water.

Record the data in Table 2.2. Group A Group B Group C Table 2.2: Grouping of samples tested in Table 2.1 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 10 Let us ﬁ nd out! Litmus is a natural substance obtained from lichens. It is available both as a solution and in the form of paper strips, known as litmus paper. The litmus paper is available in two colours—blue and red, as shown in Fig. 2.3. Substances that turn blue litmus paper to red are acidic in nature, while those that turn red litmus paper to blue are basic in nature. Since litmus shows diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic solutions, it is called an acid-base indicator. Some other substances, both natural and synthetic, can also be used as indicators. Synthetic indicators are made in laboratories, and you will learn more about them in higher grades. HOLISTIC LENS Lichens are formed by the association of two living organisms, a fungus and an alga. They grow on rocks and trees in regions that have abundant rainfall and clean air. Do you ﬁ nd lichens on trees in your neighbourhood? Lichens Now, let us classify the substances sorted in Group A, Group B, and Group C in Table 2.2. The substances in Group A, such as lemon juice, amla juice, tamarind water, and vinegar turned the blue litmus paper to red, implying that these substances are acidic in nature. The substances in Group B, such as soap solution, baking soda solution, lime water, and washing powder solution turned the red litmus paper to blue.

Hence, these substances are basic in nature. The substances in Group C, such as tap water, sugar solution, and salt solution, did not change the colour of either litmus paper. Can you predict their nature? These substances are said to be neutral because they are neither acidic nor basic. I am curious to know — what are these red and blue litmus paper strips made of? Why do they change colour when drops of some samples are put on them? Fig. 2.3: Blue and red litmus paper strips Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral 11 Now, I can check the nature of ﬂ oor cleaning liquid using an indicator! Activity 2.2: Let us relate and explore Are all the substances in Group A of Table 2.2 edible? Have you ever tasted these edible substances? Can you recall their taste? You will ﬁ nd that all these substances taste sour. Thus, we can say that substances that taste sour tend to contain acids and are acidic in nature. Caution — Do not taste anything until asked to do so. Do not taste any unknown substance. Some common edible substances and the names of the most common acids present in them are given in Fig. 2.4.

Now, let us take one of the substances — baking soda solution — from Group B. Rub the baking soda solution between your ﬁ ngers. What do you observe? It feels soapy or slippery. Basic substances are generally slippery to touch. Also, bases generally taste bitter, but everything that tastes bitter may not contain a base. For example, bitter gourd (karela) possesses a bitter taste but is not basic in nature. If litmus is not available, are there some other natural substances that can serve as acid-base indicators?

Can you predict why there is a change in colour? Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 18 Initially, when a drop of blue litmus solution is added to the lemon juice solution, the colour of the solution turns red. When lime water is added to this test tube, the colour of the solution eventually changes from red to blue. This shows that the solution in the test tube is no longer acidic. Lime water has neutralised the eﬀ ect of the acid. When the solution of an acid is mixed with the solution of a base in suﬃ cient quantity, we ﬁ nd that the resulting solution is neither acidic nor basic. Such reactions are called neutralisation reactions. In a neutralisation reaction, salt and water are formed with the evolution (i.e., release) of heat. Acid + Base →Salt + Water + Heat There are many examples in everyday life where you can observe the use of neutralisation processes. Let us ﬁ nd out! 2.3 Neutralisation in Daily Life y Situation 1: Keerthi was observing a butterﬂ y in the garden with her hand resting on a tree trunk. Suddenly, a red ant bit her, leaving her skin red with stinging pain (Fig. 2.11). Her brother helped her by applying moist baking soda to the aﬀ ected area, which relieved the pain. What do you think might be the reason for this? When an ant bites, it injects an acidic liquid (formic acid) into the skin. The eﬀ ect of the acid can be neutralised by rubbing moist baking soda, which is a base. What remedies do people use to treat ant bites in your region? Situation 2: On the"}

Situation 2: On the Farmer’s Portal (an online platform from the Department of Agriculture, Cooperation and Farmers Welfare), a query from a farmer states, “My plants are not growing well lately”. After a detailed discussion, it was found that the excessive use of chemical fertilisers (substances added to soil to help plants grow better) made the soil acidic. What remedy might be provided to him? When the soil is too acidic, the plants do not grow well. It can be treated with lime, which is a base. (Fig. 2.12). Fig. 2.11: Stinging eﬀ ect of an ant bite Fig. 2.12: Neutralising the acidic nature of soil Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral 19 If the soil is basic, organic matter like manure and composted leaves are added to it. Organic matter releases acids that neutralise the basic nature of the soil. Sometimes, the soil may be neutral, but the plants growing in it may still show poor health, which can be due to the deﬁ ciency of nutrients in the soil. Situation 3: Ashwin’s friend Gurbir stays near an industrial area. He shared with him that the ﬁ sh population in his neighbourhood lake was declining day by day!

Do you think that one possibility could be using a turmeric solution for the spraying liquid and a soap solution for writing on the paper? In a Nutshell Substances around us may be classiﬁ ed as acidic, basic, and neutral in nature. Extracts of lichen, red rose, red hibiscus, purple cabbage, turmeric, etc., can be used to indicate the nature of substances. Substances that show diﬀ erent colours in acidic and basic solutions are called acid-base indicators. Acids turn the colour of blue litmus to red. Bases turn the colour of red litmus to blue. Extract of red rose gives red colour in acidic solutions and green colour in basic solutions. The yellow colour of turmeric turns red in basic solutions but remains unchanged in acidic and neutral solutions. An acid and a base neutralise each other, forming salt and water, along with the evolution of heat. Many day-to-day problems like a red ant bite, acidic or basic nature of soil, and industrial waste can be attempted to be managed by the process of neutralisation.

For example, at home we plug in various devices to the electrical sockets in the wall. However, to learn about electricity, we will focus on a portable source of electricity that most of us may have used. Let us start with its use in a common device like a torchlight. Caution — The danger signs on electric poles and other appliances warn people that electricity can be dangerous if not carefully handled. Never ever perform experiments with power supply at your home or school. Even electricity from portable generators can be dangerous. Use only batteries or cells, like those in torchlights, wall clocks, radios, or remotes, for experiments with electricity. 3.1 A Torchlight g You might have used a torchlight, also called a torch or a ﬂ ashlight.

Do you notice a positive (+) sign and a negative (–) sign marked on the electric cell? Do you also notice that it has a small protruding metal cap on one side and a ﬂ at metal disc on the other side? All electric cells have two terminals; one is called positive (+ ve) while the other is negative (– ve). The metal cap is the positive terminal of the electric cell and the metal disc is the negative terminal. The electric cell is a portable source of electrical energy. 3.2.2 Battery Activity 3.3: Let us experiment Take a torch which uses two cells.

The ﬁ lament is attached to two thicker wires that support it, as shown in Fig. 3.4a. One thick wire connects to the metal case at the lamp’s base, while the other connects to the metal tip at the centre of the base (Fig. 3.4b).

Unlike incandescent lamps, LEDs do not have ﬁ laments (Fig. 3.6). They also have two terminals, but one is positive (attached to a longer wire) and the other is negative (the shorter wire). A torch may use one or more LEDs, sometimes of diﬀ erent shapes, in its lamp. After having learnt about the electric cell, battery, and electric lamps, we are now ready to make the torch lamp glow using an electric cell or battery. 3.2.4 Making an electric lamp glow using an electric cell or battery Activity 3.6: Let us construct Take an electric cell, an incandescent lamp used in a torch, a cell holder, a lamp holder, and four lengths of electric wire. Remove about 1 cm of the plastic covering from both ends of each wire to expose the metal. Attach two wires to the two ends of the cell holder as shown in Fig. 3.7a.

Some of the ways in which the lamp and the cell can be connected are shown in Table 3.1.  Predict, for each arrangement, if the lamp will glow or not and write your prediction in Table 3.1.  Now, connect the lamp and the cell, and observe if the lamp glows or not.

Compare these with those in which the lamp does not glow. Can you ﬁ nd the reason for the diﬀ erence? 3.2.5 An electrical circuit The lamp glows when one terminal of the lamp is connected to one terminal of the electric cell and the other terminal of the lamp to the other terminal of the cell as shown in Fig. 3.9. This setup forms an electrical circuit, which provides a complete path for electric current to ﬂ ow through the lamp. The lamp glows only when current passes through the circuit. The direction of electric current in an electrical circuit is taken to be from the positive to the negative terminal of the electric cell. When the terminals of the lamp are connected with those of the electric cell by wires, the current passes through the ﬁ lament of the incandescent lamp and makes it glow. With an incandescent lamp, it does not matter which of its terminals connects to the positive or negative terminal of the cell. The lamp will glow as long as the circuit is complete and current ﬂ ows through the ﬁ lament. FASCINATING FACTS Sometimes, an incandescent lamp does not glow even when connected to a cell. We say the lamp has ‘fused’ usually due to a broken ﬁ lament. A broken ﬁ lament stops the ﬂ ow of current, preventing the lamp from glowing. Let us now try to make an LED glow.

How will you decide which is the positive terminal of this battery? The terminal of the holder which is connected to the positive terminal of one cell is positive and the one connected to the negative terminal of the other cell is the negative terminal. Now, connect the free end of the battery positive terminal wire to the longer wire of LED, and the free end of the second wire to the shorter wire of LED (Fig. 3.10c).

You would have observed that the LED glows in the ﬁ rst case (Fig. 3.10c) and does not glow in the other (Fig. 3.10d). It is because the current can pass through the LED in one direction only.

Does the lamp glow? Rotate the free end of the safety pin till it touches the other drawing pin as shown in Fig. 3.8b. Does the lamp glow now? When the safety pin touches both drawing pins, it closes the gap and completes the path, and allows the current to ﬂ ow. We call this the ON position (Fig. 3.8b) where the circuit is closed and current ﬂ ows from the cell’s positive to negative terminal making the lamp glow. When the safety pin does not touch the second drawing pin, the gap in the circuit prevents current ﬂ ow, and the lamp does not glow. In this OFF position (Fig. 3.8a), we say that the circuit is open. Note that a switch can be placed anywhere in a circuit. A switch is a simple device that either completes or breaks a circuit.

Identify the objects that are lustrous in appearance and hard. You might have observed that objects made from copper, aluminium, and iron are lustrous in appearance and are hard. Lustre shown by metals is known as metallic lustre. Materials like copper, aluminium, and iron are known as metals, whereas, coal, sulfur, and wood are non-lustrous and not as hard as metals. Are all metals hard and solid? Not really; some metals like sodium and potassium are so soft that they can be cut with a knife. There is one metal, mercury, that is found in a liquid state at room temperature, which you might have seen in thermometers. Recall the chapter ‘Temperature and its Measurement’ from the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity. Which objects did you ﬁ nd become ﬂ at on beating with a hammer? You must have observed that objects such as a piece of copper, an iron nail, and a piece of aluminium become ﬂ at when beaten; whereas other objects or materials behave diﬀ erently. This property by which materials can be beaten into thin sheets is called malleability. Most metals possess this property. Can you give some examples of metal sheets?

On the other hand, wood neither gets ﬂ attened into a sheet nor breaks into pieces. Therefore, wood is neither malleable nor brittle. HOLISTIC LENS The impact of iron on the progress of civilisation of India In the Grade 6 Social Science textbook Exploring Society India and Beyond, you learnt about the Harappans. They knew how to use metals like copper and gold. They used these metals to make various objects, from utensils to jewellery. However, you would hardly ﬁ nd any evidence of the Harappans using a very prominent metal iron, which you see a lot around you today. This is because it took a long time before iron was used in day-to-day activities. However, once the use of iron gained prominence in the times that followed, it contributed signiﬁ cantly to the progress of civilisation in India. For instance, due to its strength, agricultural tools like ploughs made from iron were much superior to those used previously. What could be the potential reason that it is generally considered that copper was discovered earlier as compared to iron? w t f I m t 4.1.2 Ductility Where do you ﬁ nd the use of metal wires?

You might have seen wires of metals like copper or aluminium in electrical ﬁ ttings. Some ornaments, like bangles, necklaces, earrings, etc., are also made from metal wires. Metal wires play important functions in a variety of stringed musical instruments, such as veena, sitar, violin, and guitar. This property of materials by which they can be drawn into wires is called ductility. This property of ductility is mainly possessed by metals. Gold is so ductile that one gram of it can be drawn into a 2 kilometre-long wire! The ductile nature of metals enables for the creation of this tea strainer with metal wire. The World of Metals and Non-metals 45 Have you ever seen wires made of coal or sulfur? Obviously not! We can say that coal and sulfur are not ductile. Do you know that ropes made of steel [a mixture of metal (iron) and non-metal (carbon)] wires can support heavy loads? Therefore, they are used in suspension bridges and in cranes to lift heavy objects.

This property of metals that enables them to produce a ringing sound is called sonority, and metals are said to be sonorous in nature. Oh! The ringing sound of my ghungroos is also due to the sonority of metals. Now, I understand! The ringing sound of the school bell is due to the sonority of metals.

Wooden spoon Metal spoon Fig. 4.3: Metal and wooden spoons immersed in hot water The World of Metals and Non-metals 47 Some discussion points: Which of the spoons get hotter? What does this experiment tell us about heat transfer along the two spoons? You may have noticed that the metal spoon is hotter to touch than the wooden spoon. Even though both spoons are immersed in the water of the same temperature and for the same time. This shows that the heat transfers through the metal spoon, making it hotter. In contrast, the wooden spoon transfers heat poorly. In such cases, the transfer of heat from one point to another of a material is called conduction, and materials that transfer heat are called conductors. Based on the observations, one can say that metals are good conductors of heat, whereas wood is a poor conductor of heat. Now, we can understand why mostly metal vessels are used for cooking, and their handles are made with wood or other materials that do not conduct heat. You will learn more about this in the chapter ‘Heat Transfer in Nature’. 4.1.5 Conduction of electricity Have you ever seen an electrician using a screwdriver?

We learnt that metals are generally hard, lustrous, malleable, ductile, and good conductors of heat and electricity. Now, let us learn how metals behave in the presence of air and water. 4.2 Eﬀ ect of Air and Water on Metals: Iron You would have often noticed that iron objects develop brown deposits when left in the open for a few days. In which conditions would an iron object develop brown deposits? When it comes into contact with dry air only. When it comes into contact with water only. When it comes into contact with both air and water.

It is the substance that is used in small pouches in some medicine bottles, water bottles, shoe boxes, etc., to keep them dry. Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘B’. Pour freshly boiled and cooled water (to remove dissolved gases) into it until the iron nail is completely dipped in it. Now, pour some oil to form a layer over the surface of the water (Fig. 4.4b). The layer of oil on the surface of the water prevents the air from dissolving in the water. Cap the glass bottle tightly. Place one iron nail in the glass bottle ‘C’, and pour some water so that the iron nail is partially dipped. Keep this glass bottle unstoppered. This allows the iron nail to come into contact with both water and air, as shown in Fig. 4.4c. Place all the glass bottles undisturbed at room temperature and observe the changes for 8 – 10 days. Record your observations in Table 4.3.

This indicates that brown deposits or discolouration on the iron nails do not develop when the iron nail is kept in dry air alone (bottle A) or water alone (bottle B). However, in glass bottle C, the iron nail shows the presence of brown deposits. This indicates that the presence of both water and air is essential for these deposits to develop. Thus, moist air is responsible for the development of brown deposits on objects made of iron. This brown deposit is called rust. The process of formation of rust on objects made of iron is called rusting. Many other metals also exhibit discolouration when kept open in the atmosphere. Have you noticed the formation of a green coating on the surface of copper objects or a black coating on the surface of silver objects? Gradual deterioration of metal surfaces caused by air, water, or other substances is known as corrosion. Do you know that rusting of iron is a serious problem in our country? Every year, an enormous amount of money is spent to replace or repair iron structures damaged due to rusting. The rusting of iron can be prevented by several methods such as painting, oiling, greasing, and applying a protective layer of zinc metal on iron (galvanisation). We will learn about this in higher grades. FASCINATING FACTS The wonder of ancient Indian metallurgy! The Iron Pillar of Delhi was made in the time of Chandragupta II more than 1600 years ago.

You would observe that it changes the colour of red litmus paper to blue (Fig. 4.6); hence, it is basic in nature. Generally, oxides of metals are basic in nature.

Phosphorus is stored in water as it catches ﬁ re when exposed to atmospheric air. These substances are usually soft and dull in appearance. They are neither malleable nor ductile, and they are not sonorous. They are also poor conductors of heat and electricity. These are called non-metals. Their oxides are acidic in nature. Some other non-metals are oxygen, hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon, etc. These must not be confused with materials such as plastic, glass, wood, rubber, and paper. These materials are not classiﬁ ed as metals or non-metals because they are not elements. Metals and non-metals are sub-categories of substances called elements. An element is a substance that cannot be broken down into simpler substances. Presently 118 elements are known. These elements are the basic building blocks of all matter. Some are naturally occurring, while others are artiﬁ cially made in the laboratory, and do not exist in nature.

However, this should not give an impression in your mind that non-metals are not important in our lives. We breathe in oxygen, which is a non-metal, and without it, we would not be able to survive. Can you think of any other uses of oxygen? Carbon is essential in everyday life because it is the building block of all life forms. It is a key component of proteins, fats, and carbohydrates, which are necessary for growth and energy. Nitrogen is used in the manufacturing of fertilisers and other chemicals. It is an essential nutrient for the growth of plants. Chlorine is a non-metal commonly used in water puriﬁ cation. A solution of iodine, a non-metal, is applied on wounds as an antiseptic. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Do you know that many metals and their alloys (mixtures of two or more metals or a metal and a non-metal) are important for daily use as utensils and tools. These are also important for modern technologies and essential in almost every industry. Some special metals are also used in atomic energy (such as zirconium), aerospace (titanium), etc. In India, many metals, especially iron and aluminium, are recycled to minimise waste and contribute to sustainability.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 62 5.3 Some Other Processes Involving Chemical Changes g 5.3.1 Rusting In the rusting of iron, which you studied in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-metals’, a new brown-coloured substance called rust is formed. Thus, rusting is also a chemical change because it involves the formation of a new substance, iron oxide (Fig. 5.4). 5.3.2 Combustion Let us recall the burning of a magnesium ribbon (Fig. 5.5) learnt in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-metals’. Can you predict if this is a physical or a chemical change? When the magnesium ribbon is burnt, a new substance, magnesium oxide, is formed. So, the burning of magnesium ribbon also involves a chemical change. We observed that heat and light are also produced along with the formation of a new substance in this reaction. The burning of magnesium ribbon can be represented as— Magnesium + Oxygen Magnesium oxide + Heat + Light (Ribbon) (Air) (White powder) A chemical reaction in which a substance reacts with oxygen and produces heat and/or light is called combustion. Substances that undergo combustion reactions are called combustible substances. For example, wood, paper, cotton, kerosene, etc., are combustible substances.

Fig. 5.6: Candle (a) burning (b) covered with a glass tumbler (a) (b) Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical 63 We observe that the candle that was not covered (Fig. 5.6a) continues to burn, whereas the candle that was covered with a glass tumbler (Fig. 5.6b) stops burning after some time. Why does this happen? Since the candle covered by the glass tumbler does not have a continuous supply of air, the ﬂ ame gets extinguished soon. The component of air that supports combustion is oxygen. This can be conﬁ rmed by the presence of carbon dioxide in the glass tumbler inverted on the candle. How can you test the presence of carbon dioxide gas? You can test the carbon dioxide gas by adding a small amount of lime water in the petri dish. You will notice that it turns milky. This carbon dioxide was formed by the carbon from the wax and the oxygen from the air. In other words, oxygen is required for combustion.

FASCINATING FACTS Nature’s wonders: You might have seen some insects emitting light in a garden or a ﬁ eld in late evenings. These insects are called ﬁ reﬂ ies, and their light is produced by a chemical change. This type of light production (without heat) in living organisms is called bioluminescence. Fireflies Fireflies Is the Presence of Air Enough for Combustion? We learnt above that combustible substances and oxygen are necessary for combustion. We also know that paper is a combustible substance, but we can keep it in the air for any length of time without it catching ﬁ re. What else is needed to start combustion? Let us learn about this.

Thus, we ﬁ nd that a substance can burn even without ﬁ re. How do we explain this change? Focusing sunrays on the paper heats it. The temperature of the paper increases with time. After some time, the paper becomes so hot that it starts burning. This minimum temperature at which a substance catches ﬁ re is called its ignition temperature. Since the temperature of the lighted matchstick was already higher than the ignition temperature of the paper, it caught ﬁ re almost immediately. Fig. 5.7(a): Focusing the sunrays using a magnifying glass Fig. 5.7(b): Paper catching fire So, we can conclude that for the combustion process to occur, there are three requirements (Fig. 5.8) — (i) A combustible substance, also called ‘fuel’ (ii) Oxygen (iii) Heat that allows the fuel to reach its ignition temperature. 5.4 Can Physical and Chemical Changes Occur in the Same Process?

This shows that the burning of a candle involves both physical and chemical changes. KNOW A SCIENTIST The candle you just observed has long been an object of curiosity for several scientists including Michael Faraday, who made signiﬁ cant contributions to several areas of science. In the nineteenth century, Faraday delivered a series of lectures called Chemical History of a Candle. Faraday believed that the candle was the perfect object to introduce scientiﬁ c study. Through it, he discussed diﬀ erences between various physical and chemical processes like melting, vapourisation, and combustion.

For example, when ice melts, it can be refrozen into ice. Similarly, when water evaporates, it can be condensed back into liquid water. However, some changes cannot be reversed since we cannot get the original object or substance back after the change. For example, chopped vegetables cannot return to their original size and shape, and making popcorn cannot go back to its original form. Thus, changes around us could be grouped into those that can be reversed and those that cannot be reversed. 5.6 Are All Changes Desirable? g Many useful changes happen in our daily life. For example, the changing of milk into curd, ripening of fruits, cutting of fruits, and cooking of food. All these are desirable changes. Can you think of some other desirable changes happening around you? Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical 67 On the other hand, some changes may be undesirable, such as the rusting of iron or the decay of food during its storage. A change that is undesirable in some situations may be desirable in other situations. For example, decomposition of food can be very useful in converting food waste into compost. Some changes occurring over the years due to human activity can have a long-term environmental impact. For example, the increased consumption of fuels in cars, trains, aeroplanes, etc., is increasing the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution. 5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes g 5.7.1 Weathering of rocks Have you seen heaps of sand, soil,"}

Drying of paint on walls, doors, furniture, etc., releases many substances through evaporation, causing atmospheric pollution. 5.7 Some Slow Natural Changes g 5.7.1 Weathering of rocks Have you seen heaps of sand, soil, and stones lying at the base of mountains as shown in Fig. 5.10a? These are called sediments. How have these formed? These are formed by physical changes that break up large rocks into smaller pieces. Temperature changes due to climatic conditions, growing roots of trees, and even freezing of water within cracks in the rocks can cause them to break. Water or chemicals present in water, can also react with the rocks and cause chemical changes in their composition. An example of such a chemical change is shown in Fig. 5.10b. Here, an originally black-coloured rock called basalt, which contains iron, has chemically changed to produce a red-coloured layer. The red colour is a result of the iron oxide produced when the rock surface was exposed for a long time to water or air containing water vapour. These physical and chemical changes in rocks are collectively called weathering, which eventually leads to the formation of soil.

This process is called erosion. Erosion during a landslide is an example of a physical change. River rocks and pebbles often appear smoother due to the constant erosion caused by the ﬂ owing water. When the speed of the water or wind decreases, such as in an ocean or a lake, the material transported during erosion settles down at the bottom. These sediments harden over time and become new rocks. Most of these changes take place over thousands of years and cannot be reversed. In a Nutshell A physical change is one in which a substance or object undergoes a change in its physical properties and no new substance is formed. A chemical change is one in which one or more new substances are formed. It involves a chemical reaction and can be represented by a chemical equation. Combustion, cooking, and rusting are examples of chemical changes. Substances that undergo combustion are combustible substances. Heat and/or light are given out during combustion. The lowest temperature at which a substance can catch ﬁ re is called its ignition temperature. Some changes can be reversed and some cannot. Some changes are desirable and some are not. Rocks undergo physical and chemical changes due to weathering to form soil. Erosion caused by ﬂ owing water and wind is a physical change.

Fig. 5.12: A chameleon Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 6 The journey of a plant generally begins with the germination of a seed. With proper nourishment, the seed becomes a sapling and matures into a young plant. This journey is marked by some specific changes. Some of the visible changes are an increase in its height, the appearance of more leaves, and the development of flowers, fruits, and new seeds. From these seeds, new plants emerge. It is quite unlikely that a seedling will develop the capabilities to produce its own seeds immediately after germination. It needs to grow and reach maturity to become capable of producing seeds. Similarly, animals also need to grow and reach maturity before they can reproduce. Some animals lay eggs that hatch into young ones, while others, like humans, directly give birth to young ones. In both cases, the young ones gradually grow in size and develop over time. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 74 The journey of life of a human can be divided into different stages—infancy, childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and old age. Each person experiences these stages at their own pace, and the duration of each stage may vary from one individual to another. From infancy to adulthood, our bodies undergo various changes. Until around 10–12 years of age, most changes are related to height and weight. After this, other noticeable changes begin to occur, marking the onset of adolescence.

After this, other noticeable changes begin to occur, marking the onset of adolescence. This is a period of rapid growth and development, typically occurring between the ages of 10–19. During adolescence, the body prepares for adulthood. Humans, like most other living beings, can not reproduce immediately after their birth. Their bodies need to grow and reach a stage of maturity to be able to reproduce. As humans grow and develop, they experience significant physical, emotional, and behavioural changes, along with the ability to reproduce. Some of these changes may be quite clearly observable, while others occur internally and may go unnoticed. In this chapter, you will explore adolescence, understand its importance, and learn how to handle it with a sense of responsibility. 6.1 Growing With Age: The Teenage Years During the summer vacation, Venkatesh visited his grandparents.

If yes, then it is because you are also reaching this stage gradually. This stage starts around 10 years of age and can continue up to the age of 19. It is usually a stage of development between childhood and adulthood, and is called adolescence. While analysing Table 6.1, you might have noticed the following: Changes in body structure, weight gain, and strength As boys grow, it might be seen that along with growing taller, they gain weight, their shoulders might become a bit broader, and their chests may get wider. Girls also undergo changes in height and weight, and other body changes like development of breasts. Increase in height From birth, our body undergoes continuous growth and development including an increase in height. However, the increase in height becomes more prominent during adolescence.

However, it is not noticeable in every individual. The voice box also grows in adolescent girls but it is not as big as in the boys, leading to only slight changes in voice. Changes in facial skin: emergence of pimples Another common occurrence during the adolescent years is a skin condition called acne, in which small, reddish pimples appear. These are commonly visible on the face. Acne occurs due to an increase in oily secretions from the skin during adolescence that can clog the skin pores and lead to infections. While acne is a condition, pimples are a manifestation of it. Appearance of hair in different parts of body Both boys and girls experience the growth of hair in different parts of their bodies, such as the armpits and pubic region. Boys often develop facial hair, which later grows into a moustache and a beard as they move towards adulthood. Some boys may also develop chest hair and back hair, though few boys may have no significant hair growth. Variations in and timing of appearance of hair growth is completely normal. A key point to remember Whether it is a change in height, voice, or facial hair, it is important to recognise that the timing, nature, and extent of these changes vary among individuals. These variations are completely normal. Each person experiences adolescence at his or her own pace, and its duration also varies from one person to another.

Adam's apple Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 77 Now, we have understood some of the changes that take place during adolescence, particularly those that are easily observable. Some of these characteristic changes, like change in voice, the growth of facial and chest hair in boys, and the development of breasts in girls are not directly involved in the process of reproduction. However, these characteristic changes help distinguish males from females. For this reason, they are called secondary sexual characteristics. Secondary sexual characteristics are natural signs that the body is preparing for adulthood. They mark the onset of puberty. Puberty is the stage in which the body of an adolescent undergoes external and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of reproduction. 6.2 Changes that Indicate Reproductive Capability Adolescence is marked not only by observable changes but also by internal changes that are not visible from the outside. One such change is the maturation of various parts involved in the process of reproduction. Both boys and girls experience such changes gradually, and these changes are a natural part of the process of growing up. An important internal change associated with adolescent girls is the onset of the menstrual cycle. It recurs generally every 28–30 days and is more commonly known as ‘the period’. Many healthy girls may have longer or shorter menstrual cycles ranging from 21–35 days. The menstrual cycle is an important natural process and is one of the signs of good reproductive health.

Some girls may feel pain or discomfort in the lower abdomen during these days. Usually, by the age of 45–55, menstruation stops naturally, marking the end of the reproductive capability in a woman’s life. Breaking myths about menstruation There are many wrong beliefs about menstruation that often lead to unnecessary fear, shame, or even guilt. These beliefs have given rise to certain myths and taboos. Among such myths and taboos, physical isolation of menstruating girls is unfortunately still quite prevalent. Menstruation is a natural process, and such myths have no scientific basis. By encouraging a scientific outlook towards menstruation, we can help society appreciate the need to promote good reproductive health of women and contribute positively towards a healthier lifestyle for women. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 78 Adolescence is not just about physical changes or changes associated with reproductive capability but also about emotional and behavioural changes. Let us discuss them! 6.3 Emotional and Behavioural Changes in Adolescents Activity 6.2: Let us list Take a moment to think if there are any changes in your emotions or behaviour or that of your classmates and friends in the past one or two years.

This is because adolescence is often marked by stronger emotions than childhood. These emotions might affect adolescents’ behaviour like taking up/joining social initiatives to support the needy and the disadvantaged, or developing deeper interest in new areas. Understanding how our emotions influence our behaviour and actions, can help us make better choices and respond to situations thoughtfully. Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 79 6.4 Making Adolescence a Joyful Experience The journey of adolescence is a unique experience. Heightened curiosity and excitement during this stage of life give adolescents a new viewpoint towards almost everything around them. Good habits, thoughtful decisions, and small actions can have a powerful positive impact on the overall well-being of adolescents. Let us know about them! 6.4.1 Meeting nutritional needs In Grade 6 chapter ‘Mindful Eating: A Path to a Healthy Body’, you learnt about the need for a healthy diet.

Discuss the sources of vitamin B12 with your teacher. 6.4.2 Personal hygiene Besides nutrition, personal hygiene is also crucially important during adolescence. Maintaining body hygiene, particularly in the armpits and the pubic region, may protect us from potential infections. For girls, maintaining proper hygiene during menstruation is essential for both comfort and health. Menstrual hygiene can be maintained using items such as sanitary pads (Fig. 6.1) and reusable cloth pads designed for this purpose. The government also attempts to provide these products free of charge or at a low price to improve the menstrual hygiene of girls and women. As a society, we should all make efforts to ensure the availability of necessary facilities in schools and public places to promote menstrual hygiene. Collectively, we should move forward, reducing any stigma around sanitary pads and helping in menstrual hygiene. It is important to dispose of used sanitary pads properly by wrapping them in newspaper and disposing inside a dustbin. This is to ensure community health and environmental cleanliness. These days, biodegradable sanitary pads are also available that are environment-friendly. Fig. 6.1: Sanitary pad Adolescence: A Stage of Growth and Change 81 Science and Society To support menstrual hygiene, the government has introduced several initiatives—  Menstrual Hygiene Scheme (MHS): Under this scheme by the Government of India, sanitary pads are provided free of charge or at a reduced price to adolescent girls in rural areas.

It encourages peer education, where older students help younger ones learn about these topics.  Suvidha Sanitary Napkin Initiative: Under this initiative, biodegradable sanitary pads are provided at affordable prices through Jan Aushadhi Kendras. The initiative aims to improve access to menstrual hygiene products for women and adolescent girls.  State-Level Initiatives: Various state governments have their own programmes, such as the ‘Shuchi Scheme’ in Karnataka and free sanitary napkin schemes in states like Tamil Nadu and Odisha. These programmes aim to distribute free sanitary pads in government schools. 6.4.3 Physical activities Fig. 6.2: Physical activities for fitness Regular exercise and physical activities are also very important during adolescence. Do you exercise regularly or participate in games and sports? What kinds of exercises do you do? These activities will keep your body and mind fit and healthy, build up your stamina and boost your mood (Fig. 6.2). Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 82 6.4.4 Balanced social life We all live in a society and interact with each other in our day-to-day life. We should all be polite and respectful towards each other (Fig. 6.3). This helps create a favourable and safe environment.

Since adolescence is a stage of life marked by new experiences and emotions, we must be thoughtful and responsible while interacting with others — whether in person or through social media. This is the time adolescents may feel attracted to their peers, and mimic their behaviour. Today, they often interact with each other online. Fig. 6.3: Collaborative learning in action Modern technologies have made online platforms available for all to obtain information, make connections, interact, and share information with each other. We should use these platforms responsibly for the collective well-being of all. Sometimes, we, knowingly or unknowingly, use social media platforms carelessly. Seeking guidance from elders and teachers can help use these platforms positively. Science and Society Cyberbullying involves the use of digital devices such as phones, computers, or online platforms to harass others by sending misleading messages, spreading false rumours, or sharing personal information without consent (Fig. 6.4). However, if someone tries to bully you, it is important not to feel scared or helpless. Rather, handle it wisely and seek help from parents and teachers. Additionally, you should be cautious when uploading any picture online or sharing personal information with strangers.

Since adolescence is marked by curiosity and excitement, adolescents might get influenced by such people and try these substances. These substances are not just harmful to physical and mental health but are also addictive. This means that once people start consuming them, they develop a strong urge to take them again and again. Over time, they start using them regularly. This is called substance abuse. (a) Before (b) After Lungs Say no to addictive substances the first time and every time!

Science and Society Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan The Nasha Mukt Bharat Abhiyaan was launched by the Ministry of Social Justice and Empowerment, Government of India. It intends to reach out to the masses and spread awareness on the issue of avoiding substance abuse through active participation of the youth, women, and the community. The special focus is on the prevention of substance abuse among early-age children. The Government has launched a National De-addiction Helpline— 14446, to deal with drug addiction and to help drug addicts. 6.5 The ‘Why’ Question for Adolescence But I wonder why these changes occur at this stage of life! We now understand the different changes in adolescence and also know some ways to handle it with a sense of responsibility. Many changes in adolescence, including menstruation and other signs of puberty, are mainly due to hormones — certain chemicals produced in our bodies. Hormones play a crucial role in regulating various aspects of growth and development, contributing to the proper functioning of the body. They are produced in different parts of the body and are released at an appropriate time in response to signals from the brain. Some hormones influence mood and behaviour.

In a Nutshell  Adolescence is the period of change from childhood to adulthood. It generally begins around the age of 10 years and usually lasts until 19 years.  Adolescence is marked by significant and characteristic physical, biological, and emotional changes.  Features that help to distinguish the male from the female but are not directly involved in reproduction are called secondary sexual characteristics.  Puberty is the stage in which the body of a child undergoes observable and internal changes to develop into an adult capable of reproduction.  Adolescence in girls is also marked by start of the menstrual cycle, during which there is a discharge of blood generally after every 28–30 days, a process called menstruation. Menstruation begins at puberty and generally ends by the age of 45–55 years.  Adolescents face several emotional and behavioural changes.  Eating a balanced and healthy diet, maintaining good personal hygiene, and participating in physical activities help adolescents to stay healthy.  Addictive substances, such as tobacco, alcohol, and drugs, have adverse effects on the body and mind. It is wise to say ‘NO’ to these substances and stay away from them.  Changes that take place in the body during adolescence are primarily controlled by certain chemicals produced in the body. These chemicals are called hormones.  Proper guidance and awareness help adolescents manage physical, emotional, and behavioural changes effectively. Let Us Enhance Our Learning 1.

Both Pema and Palden are curious about why some places are so cold and others quite hot. Hearing them express their curiosity, their grandfather, a retired science teacher, says, “Kerala is closer to the equator than Sikkim and it also has a long coastline, which results in warmer and more humid weather conditions”.

Palden replies, “Yes, we learnt in Grade 6 Science and Social Science that for us on the Earth, the Sun is the main source of heat and light, and around the equator, the climate is generally hot”. As they are talking, Pema is keenly observing her grandmother cooking thukpa (a traditional Sikkimese dish) in a large metal pan. Pema asks, “Why are cooking utensils generally made of metals?” Palden immediately responds that they had studied in the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-metals’ that such materials are good conductors of heat. Heat Transfer in Nature 7 Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 90 How does heat get transferred in these materials?

Metal strip Burning candle Stand Pin Fig. 7.1: Heat transfer in a metal strip What will happen to the pins? Will they remain attached to the strip or will they fall? Predict the order in which the pins will fall from the strip. Record your observations in Table 7.1. Heat Transfer in Nature 91 You observed that the pin closest to the candle ﬂ ame (pin I) falls ﬁ rst, followed by pins II, III, and IV. Why does pin I fall before pin II? Why did all the pins not fall together? From your observations, what can you infer? Do you think that heat is being transferred along the metal strip from the end that is being heated? As the heat travels along the strip and approaches a pin, the wax holding it melts and the pin falls. Here, the transfer of heat takes place from the hot end of the strip to the colder end. The process of heat transfer from the hotter part of an object to the colder part is called conduction. In this process, the particle that gets heated, passes the heat on to its neighbour, and so on. However, the particles themselves do not move from their positions. Materials like metals that allow heat to pass through them easily are called good conductors of heat. Because metals are good conductors of heat, we use utensils made of metals for cooking. In solids, heat transfer takes place mainly through the process of conduction.

If we use a strip made of a material like wood or glass in place of a metal strip to perform Activity 7.1, the pins will not fall. Can you think of the reason for this based on our learning from the chapter ‘The World of Metals and Non-Metals’? Materials such as glass and wood do not allow heat to pass through them easily and are poor conductors (insulators) of heat. Clay and porcelain are also poor conductors of heat — that is why tea or coﬀ ee kept in such cups stays hot longer.

Similarly, air trapped between the layers of clothing acts as a poor conductor of heat and keeps us warm. The presence of air between two thin blankets is the reason why we prefer them over one thick blanket to keep us warm (Fig. 7.2). Is it possible to construct houses that are not aﬀ ected much by the outside heat and cold? Houses constructed in places with a very hot or cold climate often use the concept of heat transfer to keep them cool or warm. FASCINATING FACTS The upper regions of the Himalayas, such as the Mori block of Uttarkashi in Uttarakhand, experience an extremely cold climate and heavy snowfall during winters. Houses here are often built to stay warm during winters, with walls made of two wooden layers ﬁ lled with cow dung and mud between them. As wood and mud are poor conductors of heat, they prevent heat loss and help in keeping the houses warm. T i s d d o There are houses with outer walls that are constructed using hollow bricks that keep them warm in winters and cool in summers. This happens because the air that gets trapped in the hollow bricks is a poor conductor of heat.

Table 7.3: Recording observations and probable reasons Observation about the cups Probable reasons for the observation You observed that the cup under which the candle was placed, rises up (Fig. 7.3b). Why is it so? The air around the candle ﬂ ame heats up. As the air in the cup warms up, it expands and occupies more space. As a result, it becomes lighter and rises up. You can experience the expansion of air on heating it by placing a partially inﬂ ated balloon in the Sun (Fig. 7.4). After the air in the balloon gets heated, it expands and the balloon becomes larger. You must have observed that when an incense stick (agarbatti) is burnt, smoke rises up. Smoke is a mixture of hot gases and tiny solid particles that are released when something burns. As it is warmer than the surrounding air, it rises up.

Fig. 7.6: Measurement of the temperature of soil and water Soil Stand Water Thermometer Observe the movement of the coloured streak in the water. As you supply heat, a streak of colour starts moving up and then coming down from the sides (Fig. 7.5b). Why does the streak of coloured water go up in the middle and come down from the sides? The water at the bottom of the beaker gets heated up and becomes hot. It expands, becomes lighter, and rises. The water on the sides of the beaker is comparatively cooler and heavier, and comes down to take the place of the rising water. Then, this water gets heated and in turn also rises. This cycle continues until the entire volume of water gets heated. In this case, the entire volume of water gets heated through the actual movement of water particles. This process of heat transfer is known as convection. It is because of convection that we see the movement of the coloured streak inside the beaker. Thus, we can conclude that water, like air, gets heated up by the process of convection.

After 20 minutes, you will ﬁ nd that the temperature of the soil rises more than that of the water. This indicates that the soil heats up faster than water. Does the soil also cool faster than water? After letting the soil and water get heated, bring the set-up indoors and let it cool for 20 minutes. You will observe that the soil cools faster than water, just as it gets heated faster. People living in coastal areas experience an interesting phenomenon caused by the heating and cooling of land and water at diﬀ erent rates. As the land gets heated faster than water during the day, it causes warm air above the land to rise. This causes cooler air to move from the sea towards the land. This movement of cooler air from the sea to the land is called sea breeze (Fig. 7.7a). Hence, in hot places, sea breeze relieves people from the heat. That is why, windows of the houses in coastal areas are placed facing the sea.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 96 At night, the process reverses. In the absence of sunlight, land cools down faster than the water in the sea. As a result, the air above the sea is warmer and rises up. Cooler air from the land then moves towards the sea, creating a land breeze (Fig. 7.7b). Thus, people living near the seashore experience that the direction of the wind reverses in the day and night. 7.3 Radiation Do you remember when Pema and Palden were sitting around the ﬁ replace? They felt warm. Their grandfather tells them that the heat transfer, in this case, takes place directly from the ﬁ re (hot object) to us by a process known as radiation. The heat of the Sun reaches us through this process. Heat transfer by radiation does not require any medium. All objects radiate heat. You must have observed that a hot utensil kept away from the ﬂ ame cools down after some time. What is the reason for it? The hot utensil cools down by radiating heat to its surroundings.

Why is it more comfortable to wear white or light-coloured clothes during summers and dark-coloured clothes during winters? Light-coloured clothes reﬂ ect most of the heat that falls on them, and therefore, we feel more comfortable wearing them during summers. Dark surfaces, on the other hand, absorb more heat, and therefore, we feel more comfortable with dark-coloured clothes during winters. c w L t t a DIVE EEPER I wonder how heat from the ﬁ re reaches us? Cool land breeze Cooler land Warm air Warmer sea Fig. 7.7(b): Land breeze Heat Transfer in Nature 97 There are many examples in our daily life, where we can observe conduction, convection, and radiation happening together. Consider the case of water being heated up, as shown in Fig. 7.8. Let us identify the various ways in which the pan and the water get heated up, as well as the warmth we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot pan. Heat is transferred from the ﬂ ame to the utensil by conduction. Subsequently, water in the utensil gets heated up by convection. The warmth that we feel around the ﬂ ame and the hot utensil is due to radiation. Let us wrap up! From the activities, examples, and discussions so far, we ﬁ nd that there are three processes by which heat gets transferred. These are conduction, convection, and radiation. In conduction, heating takes place when one particle receives heat, transfers heat to the next particle in contact, and so on. The particles themselves do not move away from their positions. In convection, heat transfer takes place by the actual movement of particles. Note that in conduction and convection, a"}

FASCINATING FACTS In the upper reaches of the Himalayan region, a traditional room heater locally known as bukhari is used to keep rooms warm during winters. It consists of an iron stove in which wood or charcoal is burnt. A long pipe attached to the upper part of the heater serves as a chimney, venting out the smoke. Additionally, the bukhari can be used for cooking, as its ﬂ at top provides a platform for placing utensils. All the three processes of heat transfer are involved when this device is used for cooking and warming up the room. n y s n t. of g ri p s. r r Bukhari Fig. 7.8: Heating water in a pan Fig 7 8: Heating water in a pan Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 98 You have learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that the Sun is the main source of heat for the Earth.

Let us look at the phenomenon of water cycle to understand this in more detail. 7.4 Water Cycle y You have also learnt in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, that water exists in three states in nature. As a liquid, it ﬁ lls the oceans, rivers, and lakes on the Earth. As a solid, it forms snow, ice sheets, and glaciers in the mountains and the polar regions. As a gas, it exists in the form of water vapour in the Earth’s atmosphere. During summers, some of the snow and ice gets converted to water due to the Sun’s radiation and ﬂ ows down as rivers, and ultimately into the oceans. The melted ice is replenished by fresh snow during winters. Water in the oceans, rivers, and lakes gets heated due to the Sun, and as a result, it evaporates as water vapour. Water also evaporates from trees and plants through transpiration. When water vapour rises up, it cools down and condenses to form clouds. Clouds bring rain, snow, and hail. This process is called precipitation. The continuous movement of water — upward as water vapour and downward through precipitation, passing through soil, rocks, and plants, and ﬁ nally returning to water bodies, is called water cycle (Fig. 7.9). Thus, the water cycle helps in redistributing and replenishing water in rivers, lakes, and oceans. It also serves to conserve the total amount of water on the Earth.

Gravel 1 2 3 Sand Clay Fig. 7.10: An activity to compare the ﬂ ow of water through clay, sand and gravel Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 100 Do your ﬁ ndings match with your predictions? You may have observed that water seeps fastest through gravel, slower through sand, and slowest through clay. Why is it so? The spaces between gravel particles are wider when compared to those in sand and clay. Hence, water can seep through the gravel more easily. In this way, water seeps beneath the surface of the Earth. This process of surface water seeping through soil and rocks is called inﬁ ltration. Water can inﬁ ltrate more readily if the spaces between soil and rock particles are wider, open, and interconnected (Fig. 7.11). The water that seeps through gets stored in the pore spaces of sediments and the openings in rocks beneath the surface as groundwater. The underground layers of sediments and rocks that store water in pore spaces are called aquifers (Fig. 7.12). This is the water we extract by digging wells or drilling bore wells into aquifers. This water may be a few metres to hundreds of metres below the ground, depending on the location. Fig. 7.12: Aquifer Rain Inﬁ ltration Well Aquifer However, groundwater is not unlimited.

The growing water requirements of an increasing population have led to excessive groundwater extraction. Additionally, decreased vegetation cover and increased concrete surfaces in urban areas have limited water inﬁ ltration. As a result, groundwater is getting depleted. To address this, rainwater harvesting and recharge pits are used to replenish groundwater. Hence, the water cycle ensures that groundwater sources are recharged, thereby helping to ensure a sustainable groundwater supply.

For example, in Ladakh, people have developed innovative ways to conserve water by making ice stupas (Fig. 7.13) during the winters. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Ice Stupa During the spring season in Ladakh, streams often dry up, leading to scarcity of water as the heat from the Sun’s radiation is not enough to melt the snow on the mountains. During winters, water from mountain streams is channeled down through underground pipes. This water is then sprayed into the cold air. As it falls, it freezes due to extremely low temperatures. The ice builds up layer by layer, creating a tall, cone-shaped structure called an ice stupa as shown in Fig. 7.13. The ice stupa melts slowly during spring, providing water for farming and other needs throughout the summer.

They started noticing that many events in nature repeat themselves after deﬁ nite intervals of time. For example, the rising and setting of the Sun, the phases of the Moon and the changing seasons. They started using the cycles of these events for timekeeping. First, they devised calendars. A day was deﬁ ned by the cycle of rising and setting of the Sun. Then began the quest to ﬁ nd ways of knowing the time of day. How was time measured when there were no clocks and watches? So, they made many devices which helped them to measure smaller intervals of time within a day. Some of these were sundials, water clocks, hourglasses, and candle clocks. In a sundial, time is determined with the changing position of the shadow of an object cast by the light of the Sun during the day (Fig. 8.1). The water clocks used the ﬂ ow of water out or into a vessel to measure time. In one type, water ﬂ owed out from a vessel which had markings for time (Fig. 8.2a).

With its imposing height of 27 metres, its shadow moves at about 1 millimetre per second and falls on a scale ﬁ nely marked to measure time intervals as short as 2 seconds. Like any sundial, it measures local or ‘solar time’, requiring a correction to determine Indian Standard Time. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 108 FASCINATING FACTS In ancient India, time was measured using both shadows and water clocks. The earliest reference to shadow-based time measurement appears in the Arthasastra by Kautilya (was composed and revised between the second century BCE – third century CE). An accurate expression for time in terms of the shadow of a vertical stick was given by Varahamihira around 530 CE. The water clock with water ﬂ owing out was described in the Arthasastra, Sardulakarnavadana, and some other texts (early CE centuries). These clocks were not very accurate because as water levels dropped, the ﬂ ow rate decreased. This led to the development of the sinking bowl water clock (Fig. 8.2b), or Ghatika-yantra, ﬁ rst mentioned by Aryabhata, and then in several astronomical texts later. Time was measured constantly with Ghatika-yantra at Buddhist monasteries, royal palaces, town squares, and each time the bowl sank, it was announced by drums, conch shells, or striking a gong. Though the Ghatika-yantra was progressively replaced by pendulum clocks in the late nineteenth century, it continued to be used at the religious places for rituals. n y n"}

This led to the development of increasingly better mechanical devices for the measurement of time, driven by weights, gears, and springs from the fourteenth century onwards. However, the invention of the pendulum clock in the seventeenth century marked a major breakthrough in mechanical timekeeping. KNOW A SCIENTIST The pendulum clock was invented in 1656 and patented in 1657 by Christiaan Huygens (1629 –1695). He was inspired by the investigations of pendulums by Galileo Galilei (1564 –1642). It is said that once while sitting in a church, Galileo’s attention was drawn to a lamp suspended from the ceiling, which was swinging back and forth. Using his pulse to measure time, Galileo found that the lamp took the same time for each swing. After experimenting with diﬀ erent pendulums, Galileo concluded that the time taken to complete one oscillation was always the same for a pendulum of a given length.

Fig. 8.7 A simple pendulum (b) O A B Extreme position Extreme position Mean position (a) Rigid support Long thread Bob The pendulum at rest is in its mean position. When the bob of the pendulum is moved slightly to one side and released, it starts oscillatory motion. Its motion is periodic in nature because it repeats its path after a ﬁ xed interval of time. The pendulum is said to have completed one oscillation when its bob, starting from its mean position O, moves to extreme position A, changes direction and moves to another extreme position B, changes direction and comes back to O (Fig. 8.7b). The pendulum also completes one oscillation when its bob moves from one extreme position A to another extreme position B and comes back to A. The time taken by the pendulum to complete one oscillation is called its time period. Let us now set up a pendulum and measure its time period. Activity 8.2: Let us experiment Collect a piece of string around 150 cm long, a heavy metal ball with hook/ a stone (bob), a stopwatch/ watch, and a ruler. Tie the bob at one end of the string. Fix the other end of the string to a rigid support such that the length of the string in between support and bob is around 100 cm. Wait for the bob to come to rest.

This property is used in the measurement of time. Measurement of Time and Motion 111 All clocks, old or modern, are based on some process repeating continuously, which can be used to mark equal intervals of time. Modern clocks measure time using the same basic principle — periodically repeating processes — but use tiny and very rapid vibrations either from a quartz crystal (quartz clocks) or from some speciﬁ c atoms (atomic clocks). While Huygens’ early pendulum clocks could gain or lose 10 seconds each day, today’s atomic clocks are so precise that they lose only one second in millions of years!

The faster and more accurate our clocks become, the more they help society in ways we may not even notice! e d r t For races covering the same distance, we can tell who was faster by measuring time. But how can we tell that when comparing races for diﬀ erent distances? 8.2 Slow or Fast What do we mean when we say something is moving fast or slow?

Hence, someone who has covered more distance within the same time is running faster. The distances moved by objects in a given interval of time decide which one is faster or slower. We often say that the faster runner has a higher speed. You are probably familiar with the word ‘speed’. 8.3 Speed p By comparing the distances moved by two or more objects in a unit time, it can be found out which of them is moving faster. The unit time may be one second or one minute or one hour. We call the distance covered by an object in a unit time as the speed of the object. How can we determine the speed of an object? It can be calculated, if we know the total distance covered by an object and the time taken to cover it. The speed of an object is the total distance covered divided by the total time taken to cover it. Thus, Speed = Total distance covered Total time taken What would be the unit of speed? We know the SI units of length and time. Since the speed is distance/time, the SI unit of speed is metre/second and is expressed as m/s. Speed can also be expressed in other units. If we express the distance in kilometre and time in hour, then the unit of speed is kilometre/hour, expressed as km/h.

We can write this equation in a diﬀ erent form to calculate the distance covered by an object, if we know its speed and the time taken, by using Total distance covered = Speed × Total time taken Similarly, we can also calculate the time an object will take to cover a distance, if the distance and speed are given, by using Total time taken = Total distance covered Speed Example 8.2: Raghav is going to a neighbouring city in a bus moving at a speed of 50 km/h.

I noticed that some people seemed to be running at the same speed during that distance while some people would speed up or slow down. How were their motion diﬀ erent? 8.4 Uniform and Non-uniform Linear Motion Do you remember learning about linear motion in the chapter ‘Measurement of Length and Motion’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity? When an object moves along a straight line, its motion is called linear motion. Now, imagine a train on a track which is along a straight line between two adjacent railway stations. So, the motion of the train between these two stations is an example of linear motion (Fig. 8.11). The train starts from the ﬁ rst station A at a slow speed, then moves at a faster speed, then slows down and comes to a halt at the next station D. In between the two stations, for some distance (B to C), the train moves at a constant speed, that is, at an unchanging speed.

I i i m t Speedometer Odometer Measurement of Time and Motion 117 An object moving along a straight line with a constant speed is said to be in uniform linear motion. So, the train is in uniform motion between B and C (Fig. 8.11). On the other hand, if the speed of an object moving along a straight line keeps changing, it is said to be in non-uniform linear motion. The motion of the train between A and B, as well as between C and D, is non-uniform (Fig. 8.11). An object in uniform linear motion covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, while it covers unequal distances in equal intervals of times when it is in non-uniform linear motion. In Table 8.3, data are given for the distances travelled by two trains, X and Y, between the time 10:00 AM and 11:00 AM.

Train X covers equal distances in equal intervals of time, so it is in uniform linear motion while Train Y is in non-uniform linear motion. Uniform linear motion is an idealisation. In everyday life, we seldom ﬁ nd objects moving with a constant speed over long distances or for long intervals of time. That is why we have to use average speeds.

Life Processes in Animals 9 If your food is fully digested before you eat again, you won’t need medicine for pain. (Thirukkural 942) In the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, we learnt about processes essential for survival of living beings like nutrition, respiration, excretion, and reproduction. These are collectively called life processes. In this chapter, we will learn about life processes such as nutrition and respiration in detail. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 122 Observe your surroundings and notice what animals eat. Animals eat diﬀ erent types of food. Bees and sunbirds suck the nectar of ﬂ owers, while infants of humans and many other animals feed on their mother’s milk. Snakes, like python, swallow the animals they prey upon. Some aquatic animals ﬁ lter tiny food particles ﬂ oating nearby and feed upon them. Animals, including humans, obtain energy from food, which enables them to carry out various life processes. Animals consume food that contains complex components, such as carbohydrate, protein, and fat. These complex food components have to be broken down into simpler forms before the body can use them. But how does this process happen? Breaking down of complex food components into simpler forms occurs in a long tube called the alimentary canal. This process starts in the mouth and ends at the anus (Fig. 9.1). As food moves through this canal, digestive juices secreted at diﬀ erent parts break it down into simpler forms.

Is this process the same in all animals or does it vary? Let us ﬁ rst try to understand this process in humans. 9.1.1 Digestion in human beings Let us trace the journey of food inside our body as it passes through diﬀ erent parts of the alimentary canal. Beginning with the mouth cavity The journey of the food you eat begins when it enters your mouth. Your teeth break down food you eat into smaller pieces by the processes of crushing and chewing. This process of initial breakdown of food into ﬁ ne pieces is called mechanical digestion. Think about your favourite food. Does your mouth feel watery? Fig. 9.1: Human digestive system Stomach Oesophagus or Food pipe Liver Pancreas Large intestine Anus Mouth Small intestine Rectum Life Processes in Animals 123 This happens because of more saliva that gets released when you recall your favourite food.

Take a small piece of chapati or a bite-sized portion of boiled rice and chew it properly for 30–60 seconds. At ﬁ rst, the chapati or rice has its usual taste, but as you continue chewing, do you notice a change in taste? The food begins to taste sweet! Have you ever wondered why this happens? Chapati or rice contains starch, which is a type of carbohydrate. Our saliva contains a digestive juice that helps break down starch into sugar. This explains why starchy food, like chapati, tastes sweet when you chew it for a long time. Saliva helps to break down components of food into simpler ones.

What causes the change of colour in test tube A? In Grade 6, we learned that iodine gives a blue-black colour when it reacts with starch. In test tube A, the appearance of the blue-black colour indicates the presence of starch. In test tube B, which contains chewed boiled rice, if there is no change in colour, it indicates that the starch is no longer present; if there is only a slight change in colour, it indicates that starch is present only in very small amount. It has been broken down into simple sugars by the action of saliva. If the colour still appears in test tube B, what changes would you make in the activity to explore it further? Would the colour change if chewing time is increased? Try to ﬁ nd out by repeating the activity. Now, we know that saliva secretion in the mouth helps break down starch into sugars.

This process of breaking complex food components into simpler forms in the body is called digestion. Food is partially digested in the mouth. Let us learn how this partially digested food gets further digested through the alimentary canal. Food pipe (Oesophagus): A passage from the mouth to the stomach When you chew your food, your saliva not only helps in digesting the starch but also moistens it, making it soft and easy to swallow. Your tongue helps in mixing chewed food with saliva and pushing this softened food into a long, ﬂ exible tube called the food pipe or oesophagus (Fig. 9.2). But how does the food move down? The walls of the food pipe gently contract and relax in a wave-like motion to push the food down into the stomach. This movement takes place throughout the alimentary canal and pushes the food forward. Stomach In the stomach, the walls contract and relax to churn the food. The churned food is then mixed with a secretion from the inner lining of the stomach. The secretion from stomach contains digestive juice, acid, and mucus.

Fig. 9.3: Stomach Digestive juice, acid and mucus Stomach wall FASCINATING FACTS How did scientists learn about digestion in the human body? The discovery of how the stomach works happened by chance. In 1822, a man named Alexis St. Martin was accidentally shot in the stomach. He was treated by a doctor, William Beaumont. However, his wound never fully healed, leaving a small permanent hole. This opening allowed Dr. Beaumont to observe digestion in the stomach as it happened. He conducted experiments on how diﬀ erent foods were broken down and studied how emotions aﬀ ect digestion. Alexis St. Martin’s shotgun wound Small Intestine After its journey through the stomach, the partially digested food moves into the small intestine. Look at Fig. 9.4. It is a sketch of a stretched-out alimentary canal. Guess how long it is. You will be surprised that although it is called small intestine, it is almost 6 metres long—almost twice the height of your classroom! You will be surprised to know that the small intestine is the longest part of the alimentary canal. The small intestine receives digestive secretions from three sources—the inner lining of the small intestine itself, and two more structures associated with the alimentary canal—the liver and the pancreas (Fig. 9.4). The liver secretes bile, which is mildly basic in nature. Recall the neutralisation reaction in chapter ‘Exploring Substances: Acidic, Basic, and Neutral’. Bile neutralises acids present in the food moving down from the stomach and breaks down fats into tiny droplets, making its digestion easier. Stomach Mouth Food pipe (Oesophagus) Pancreas Small"}

Additionally, pancreatic juice also breaks down carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. The digestive juice secreted by the wall of the small intestine further breaks down fats, proteins, and partially digested carbohydrates into simpler forms. The digested nutrients pass on from the small intestine into the blood present in blood vessels found in the walls of the small intestine. This process is called absorption of nutrients. How are these nutrients absorbed from the small intestine? The inner lining of the small intestine is thin and has thousands of ﬁ nger-like projections (Fig. 9.5) that increase the surface area for eﬃ cient nutrient absorption. These ﬁ nger-like projections allow the digested nutrients to pass into the blood, which carries them to diﬀ erent parts of the body. These nutrients provide energy, support growth and repair, and help the body function properly.

The reason is that it is wider than the SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Celiac disease is a condition in which the body reacts to gluten, a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. This reaction damages the inner lining of the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed. As a result, the intestine cannot function properly. The only way to manage celiac disease is to avoid foods that contain gluten. Millets (like jowar, bajra, and ragi) are good alternatives because they are naturally gluten-free. Life Processes in Animals 127 small intestine. The large intestine absorbs water and some salts from the undigested food, thus making the waste semi-solid. This semi-solid waste is called stool. The stool is then stored in the lower part of the large intestine, called the rectum, until the body is ready to get rid of it. Eating ﬁ bre-rich foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains helps the large intestine function properly by making the stool easier to pass. Finally, it is expelled through the anus—a process known as egestion. This is how your body removes the waste it does not need, keeping you healthy! Isn’t it fascinating how the digestive system works, absorbing nutrients from food and eliminating waste? FASCINATING FACTS The large intestine contains various small living organisms, such as bacteria, that help in digestion. They help in keeping our digestive system healthy.

Fibre-rich food, and especially ‘fermented foods’ (like curd, buttermilk, shrikhand, kanji, pickles, gundruk, and poita bhat) are good for a healthy digestive system and overall well-being. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY The importance of digestion in maintaining good health has been recognised for centuries. The Charaka Samhita, an ancient Ayurvedic text, highlights the role of easily digestible foods and the judicious use of spices like ginger, black pepper, and cumin to enhance digestion. Advances in science in the area of nutrition also emphasise eating meals at proper timings, practising mindful eating, and avoiding overeating as key factors in maintaining digestive health. 9.1.2 Do all animals digest food the same way as humans do? I have seen cows keep chewing the food even when they are not actively grazing or eating anything. Why? Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 128 Grass-eating animals, such as cows (Fig. 9.6) and buﬀ aloes, partially chew the grass and swallow it into their stomachs. In the stomach, partial digestion of the food takes place. The partially digested food is brought back to the mouth for gradual chewing. This process is called rumination, and these animals are called ruminants. A cow spends about 8 hours a day just chewing the food! The thoroughly chewed food again passes down the alimentary canal for further digestion.

Food is broken down by the contraction and relaxation of the walls of the gizzard, often with the help of grit (small stones) that the birds swallow. This shows that animals exhibit variations in the structure and function of the alimentary canal to adapt to diﬀ erent ways of digesting diﬀ erent kinds of food. We have learnt that the nutrients from digested food are carried to diﬀ erent parts of the body. Some of the nutrients help build and repair the body, while others, like sugar, are broken down inside the body to release energy. The process by which nutrients are converted into usable energy is called respiration. Let us now explore how this process occurs in animals. 9.2 Respiration in Animals p We learnt in Grade 6 chapter ‘Living Creatures: Exploring their Characteristics’, that all living beings respire. Is the process of respiration the same in all animals? Let us ﬁ rst understand the process of respiration in humans. Life Processes in Animals 129 9.2.1 Respiration in humans You know that we breathe in (inhale) and breathe out (exhale) air continuously to obtain oxygen and release carbon dioxide. How is this oxygen used in the body? Are breathing and respiration diﬀ erent? Let us ﬁ nd out. How do we breathe? The process of inhaling and exhaling air is called breathing.

It is diﬃ cult to live without food for a week; without water for a day or two, but without breathing, we usually cannot survive more than a few minutes. Why is that? All of us are alive because we breathe. Not just humans, plants and other animals also breathe. But how do we breathe? Just as food follows a speciﬁ c pathway in the digestive system, our body also has a speciﬁ c system for breathing and respiration. This system is called respiratory system. The respiratory system consists of various parts as shown in Fig. 9.8. In this system, the exchange of gases follows a speciﬁ c pathway. The pathway through which the air is inhaled and exhaled involves various parts of the respiratory system assisting in the process of breathing and respiration. The respiratory system begins with a pair of nasal openings called nostrils through which we inhale and exhale air (Fig. 9.8). The inhaled air passes into a pair of small passages called the nasal passages. Have you noticed tiny hair inside your nostrils? These hair, along with mucus, help trap dust and dirt from the air we breathe in. This is why we should breathe through the nose and not through the mouth. From the nasal passages, the air reaches our lungs through the windpipe. The windpipe forms two branches, which enter the two lungs. In the lungs, these branches further divide into smaller and ﬁ ner branches that end in small balloon-like sacs called alveoli (Fig. 9.8). Our lungs are protected by the rib cage.

The lime water in test tube B turns milky (or cloudy), but the lime water in test tube A does not. What does this indicate? Lime water turns milky when it reacts with carbon dioxide. Therefore, this indicates that the exhaled air contains more carbon dioxide than the air we inhale. SCIENCE AND SOCIETY Breathing Practices for a Healthy Life Breathing exercises have been practised across diﬀ erent cultures in India and worldwide for centuries. Pranayama is well known for improving respiratory health, mind relaxation, and concentration. In Ladakh, people practise Tummo breathing, a technique that improves lung function and helps keep the body warm even in cold weather. Similarly, deep breathing techniques are used to promote well-being. Some traditions combine deep breathing with chanting, using rhythmic breath control to enhance relaxation and mental clarity. Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 132 How does the exchange of gases happen? Through the process of breathing, fresh air from outside enters the lungs and ﬁ lls the alveoli. The alveoli have thin walls surrounded by ﬁ ne tubes containing blood (Fig. 9.12). Blood carries carbon dioxide from the body to the alveoli, where it is released into the air. At the same time, oxygen from the alveoli passes into the blood and is transported to all parts of the body. Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you energy?

Have you ever wondered how the food you eat gives you energy? The key is not only the food but also the oxygen we breathe! When we eat food, our body breaks it down into simple substances like sugar (glucose). Oxygen helps break down glucose to release energy. This process is called respiration. The word equation of the process of respiration is as follows— Glucose + Oxygen Carbon dioxide + Water + Energy During breathing, we inhale air from our surroundings and exhale air having more carbon dioxide than the inhaled air. Note that not all the oxygen is used up (Fig. 9.13). Some other animals can use a larger fraction of the oxygen during respiration. This exchange of gases ensures that each segment of our body gets oxygen to produce energy and remove waste products. In simple words, breathing brings in oxygen and removes carbon dioxide, while respiration uses oxygen to break down food and release energy. This energy helps us walk, run, play, and even think! Breathing is a physical process, while respiration is a chemical process that occurs inside the body. Both the processes are essential for our survival!

It damages the lungs and increases the risk of serious diseases, including lung cancer and other respiratory illnesses. It leads to persistent coughing and frequent infections. In addition to harming the smoker, smoking releases toxic chemicals into the air, putting others at risk. When non-smokers inhale this polluted air, they experience passive smoking, which can be especially dangerous for children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Due to these risks, avoiding smoking helps protect both personal health and the well-being of those around us. 9.2.2 Do other animals breathe the same way as humans do? You have learnt that diﬀ erent animals live in diﬀ erent habitats. You may have observed birds ﬂ ying and ﬁ sh swimming. How do they breathe? Animals, such as birds, elephants, lions, cows, goats, lizards, and snakes, breathe through their lungs. Although all these animals have lungs, the structure of their lungs are quite diﬀ erent. Most aquatic animals like ﬁ sh, have specialised structures known as gills (Fig. 9.14). These are richly supplied with blood vessels. The exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide between the blood and the gases dissolved in water takes place across the gills. Amphibians, like frogs, live both on land and in water.

They use diﬀ erent body parts for breathing at various stages of their life. For example, tadpoles breathe through gills, while adult frogs use lungs for breathing on land and skin for gas exchange when they stay in water. This adaptation helps them survive both in water and on land, showing how animals have adapted over time to diﬀ erent environments. Earthworms use their moist skin for the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide. Gills Fig. 9.14: Breathing body parts in a ﬁ sh Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 134 Thus, diﬀ erent animals have diﬀ erent breathing mechanisms to suit their unique habitats. Apart from the digestive system, the respiratory system, and the circulatory system, there are other systems which work in coordination with each other in the body and perform diﬀ erent functions to sustain life. You will study about them in higher grades. In a Nutshell Life processes such as nutrition, circulation, respiration, excretion, and reproduction are essential for the survival of living beings.

You are likely to ﬁ nd that the plant in Pot A, kept in direct sunlight with adequate water, grows better than the plant in Pot C, which gets adequate water but no sunlight. The plant in Pot B may have died as it did not get water even though it received adequate sunlight. What do you infer from the observations made in this activity? The results indicate that plants require both sunlight and water for their growth. 1 This experiment will need two weeks. Teachers can plan this activity accordingly.

It records useful observations about plant growth, soil, and agricultural practices to help improve crop health, growth and production. The knowledge in the text seems to be based on practical experiences and patterns seen over time. These ideas were then systematically documented to guide farming practices. For instance, there are references to diﬀ erent methods of organic manure preparation, such as mixing water, barley, and various seeds, like green, black, and horse grams. ds to he er ng ic ke 10.2 How Do Plants Get Food for their Growth? We know that animals get their food from plants, either directly by eating plants or indirectly by eating animals that in turn eat plants for their nutrition and growth. But how do plants obtain the food they need to grow? Unlike animals, plants do not eat food. 10.2.1 Leaves: the ̒ food factories̓ of plants Plants store food in the form of starch, a type of carbohydrate. This starch is produced in the leaves of a plant which, by design, are generally broad and ﬂ at. These are mostly green because of the presence of a green pigment called chlorophyll, that helps in capturing sunlight eﬃ ciently. Let us ﬁ nd out the role chlorophyll plays in the preparation of food in the form of starch in plants. p Activity 10.2: Let us check (demonstration activity) The teacher may demonstrate"}

Wait for a few minutes and observe. If the colour of the leaf changes to blue-black, it indicates the presence of starch. Caution — Alcohol should never be placed near a heat source directly, as it is highly ﬂ ammable and can easily lead to ﬁ re and burns. Did you wonder why we decolourise the leaf in the beginning of this activity? Decolourisation of a leaf enables us to easily observe colour change and, thus, the presence of starch.

Bhaskar loves gardening during his free time. Being a curious student, he often looks around his garden and wonders how plants produce food. From his experiences, Bhaskar knows that water and sunlight are essential for plant growth. But he wonders if sunlight contributes to the production of food in the form of starch in plants. How does sunlight contribute in the production of starch in plants? Activity 10.3: Let us check Bhaskar took a leaf having both green and non-green patches from each of two similar potted plants — one kept in sunlight and the other kept in the dark for 36 hours. He wanted to compare the leaves before and after the starch test. He made a sketch of the leaves to record the location of the green and the non-green patches on them with the help of a tracing paper. After that, he performed an iodine test (as shown in Activity 10.2) on the leaves. Bhaskar recorded his observations in Table 10.2.

Bhaskar also recorded that the leaf obtained from the plant kept in the dark does not show a blue-black colour, even on the green patches, indicating that no starch has been produced. Non-green patches of the leaf obtained from the plant placed in sunlight do not turn blue-black. Does it indicate that there is no chlorophyll present in those patches? The non-green patches may not have suﬃ cient chlorophyll to prepare enough starch to be detected using the iodine test. FASCINATING FACTS Some plant leaves appear red, violet, or brown because they contain more of these coloured pigments than the green-coloured chlorophyll. This hides the green colour. Some of these pigments also help in photosynthesis. You can use an iodine test to check for the presence of starch in these leaves, indicating that photosynthesis has indeed taken place. t Life Processes in Plants 143 What do we infer from the observations listed in Table 10.2? As we know, leaves are mostly green because of the presence of chlorophyll. We have also seen that the starch is produced where green patches of the leaf are present. We can infer that chlorophyll helps in preparing starch in the presence of sunlight. In fact, it is essential for the preparation of starch. Hence, the leaves are also called ‘food factories’ of plants. What else is essential for the preparation of food in plants?

Then, locate one leaf of this plant for this experiment. Take a wide-mouthed bottle and pour some caustic soda (sodium hydroxide) into it (caustic soda absorbs carbon dioxide from the air). Caution — Caustic soda is a strong chemical that can cause skin burns; only teachers should handle it. Insert half of the destarched leaf into the bottle through a split cork, leaving the other half of the leaf outside, and place the bottle as shown in Fig. 10.3a.

Table 10.3: Role of air in the preparation of starch by plants Availability of Part of the leaf inside the bottle Part of the leaf Part of the leaf outside the bottle Water Chlorophyll Sunlight Carbon dioxide Starch present (Yes/No) We notice that the part of the leaf that was outside the bottle turns blue-black, indicating the presence of starch. However, the part of the leaf inside the bottle does not turn blue-black in colour, indicating that food is not made in that part of the leaf. This is because the caustic soda solution inside the ﬂ ask absorbs the carbon dioxide present in the air. What does this experiment show? This experiment shows that carbon dioxide present in the air is essential for plants to prepare starch. Based on Activities 10.3 and 10.4, what do you conclude? Which part of the plant is involved in the synthesis of starch? Based on our learnings so far, we have found that sunlight, water, chlorophyll and carbon dioxide are essential for the synthesis of food in plants. This process by which plants prepare food in the presence of sunlight and chlorophyll is called photosynthesis. A leaf is the primary site for photosynthesis. Do other green parts of the plant also perform photosynthesis? Yes, other parts of the plants which have chlorophyll also perform photosynthesis. So far, we have learnt that plants take in carbon dioxide from the air and water, and use sunlight to prepare their food by the process of photosynthesis.

Let us explore this through an experiment performed by Barkha didi. Activity 10.5: Let us explore Look at Fig. 10.4. Compare the two set-ups labelled as A and B, and analyse. In Fig. 10.4, set-up A is placed in sunlight, and set-up B is placed in the dark. What diﬀ erence do you observe in the two set-ups? Do you observe air bubbles emerging in the inverted test tube in set-up A? The gas produced in this set-up caused bubbles to emerge and get accumulated in the inverted test tube. Which gas is this? Fig. 10.4: Activity showing the release of oxygen during photosynthesis B Beaker Inverted test tube Funnel Water plant A f yg g p She inferred that the gas in the test tube is rich in oxygen. It indicates that oxygen is released during the process of photosynthesis. It also indicates that photosynthesis occurs in the presence of sunlight. When suﬃ cient gas was accumulated in the inverted test tube, Barkha didi placed her thumb on the mouth of the test tube while taking the test tube oﬀ the set-up. She then quickly inserted a lit matchstick into the tube and the matchstick produced an intense ﬂ ame. Oh yes! I remember.

Air bubbles Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 146 10.2.3 Photosynthesis: in a nutshell We know that water, sunlight, carbon dioxide from the air, and chlorophyll are necessary to carry out the process of photosynthesis that produces carbohydrates (Fig. 10.5). During photosynthesis, food is actually produced in the form of glucose, a simple carbohydrate. This glucose not only serves as an instant source of energy but also later gets converted into starch for storage. The word equation of photosynthesis is given below — Sunlight Carbon dioxide + Water Glucose + Oxygen Chlorophyll KNOW A SCIENTIST Many scientists across the world contributed to develop an understanding of photosynthesis. In India, Rustom Hormusji Dastur (1896–1961) studied the process of photosynthesis. He was a plant scientist and served as the head of the Botany Department at the Royal Institute of Science, Bombay (now the Institute of Science, Mumbai), from 1921–1935. He studied eﬀ ects of the amount of water and temperature on photosynthesis. He examined the importance of water, temperature, and the colour of light in the process of photosynthesis. 10.2.4 How do leaves exchange gases during photosynthesis? We now know that photosynthesis requires carbon dioxide, and oxygen is released in the process. Which part of the plant helps in the exchange of carbon dioxide and oxygen? Let us conduct an activity to understand where the exchange of gases takes place.

What do you observe? Do you notice tiny pores on the peel, as shown in Fig. 10.6? These pores are called stomata. Stomata, present on the surface of leaves, help in the exchange of gases. 10.3 Transport in Plants p 10.3.1 Transport of water and minerals All living beings need water to grow. Plants use water in the process of photosynthesis. Water, along with minerals present in the soil, is taken up by the roots of a plant. Minerals are important nutrients for the growth of plants.

How does the red colour ink move upwards? This is due to the thin tube-like structure called the xylem present in the stem, branches, and leaves of plants. Just like red ink, minerals dissolved in water also move up the stem through the xylem. Now, we know that water and minerals are transported to the leaves and other parts of plants through the xylem (Fig. 10.8). The water transported through the xylem is used to perform various functions. How does food get transported to other parts of a plant? 10.3.2 Transport of food We know that leaves are the primary site for photosynthesis. The food prepared by plants in the leaves is transported to all parts of the plant. This food is transported through another set of thin tube-like structures called the phloem (Fig. 10.8).

Compare both the test tubes for any change in colour. Does the lime water turn milky in both the test tubes? Why does the lime water turn milky in the test tube connected to the ﬂ ask? Lime water turns milky due to the presence of more carbon dioxide in the ﬂ ask. But where does this carbon dioxide come from?

After growing the plant properly for some time, seal the mouth of the bottle. Observe the growth of the plant. If the plant is growing well that means the plant is maintaining the exchange of gases, that is, carbon dioxide produced in the process of respiration of the plant is utilised for performing photosynthesis, and oxygen generated in photosynthesis is utilised in respiration by the plant inside the bottle. How are plant processes like photosynthesis, respiration, and water and food transportation crucial for crop production? Visit a greenhouse, if there is one near your place.

Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 154 11.1 Sources of Light g The Sun gives out or emits its own light and is the main source of natural light on the Earth. Stars, lightning, natural ﬁ re, and certain animals also emit their own light (Fig. 11.1). In ancient times, humans learnt to create ﬁ re — the earliest form of artiﬁ cial lighting. With time, they learnt to create ﬁ re using diﬀ erent fuels, such as animal fat, oil, wax, and gas (Fig. 11.2). With the invention of electricity and diﬀ erent kinds of electric light sources, most of the lighting needs of humans are now met by electric lighting (Fig. 11.3). Objects that emit their own light are called luminous objects. Objects that do not emit their own light are called non-luminous objects. The Moon is a non-luminous object. It does not emit its own light. It just reﬂ ects the light emitted by the Sun that falls on it.

Avoid using high-power lasers for this activity; a low-power laser pointer is suﬃ cient. Never point the laser beam directly at anyone’s eyes, as it can cause serious eye damage. Pass a laser beam through a beaker ﬁ lled with water in which a drop of milk is added to make the laser beam easily visible. What do you observe? Do you see that the beam of laser light inside water follows a straight path? However, light can sometimes even bend around corners! This is something you will learn in the higher grades.

Note your observation in Table 11.1. Repeat this for all the objects. Was your observation the same as your prediction? What conclusions could you draw?

Did you see a dark patch on the wall? Why was this dark patch formed? We now know that light travels in a straight line. So, when an opaque object is placed in its path, light is blocked. The dark patch, where light does not reach, is the shadow.

The shape, size, and sharpness of the shadow depend on the position of the object relative to the light source and the screen. The shadows may give information about the object or we may not be able to guess the object at all. Changing the colour of opaque objects does not change the colour of the shadows. FASCINATING FACTS Shadow play, or shadow puppetry, has been a part of our cultural heritage for centuries. In this art form, ﬂ at cut-out ﬁ gures called shadow puppets are placed between a light source and a screen. By moving the puppets and the light, puppeteers can create life-like movements, bringing the characters to life. Diﬀ erent regions have their own unique styles, like the Charma Bahuli Natya in Maharashtra, Keelu Bomme and Tholu Bommalata of Andhra Pradesh, Togalu Gombeyaata in Karnataka, Ravana Chhaya in Odisha, Tholpavakoothu in Kerala, and Bommalattam in Tamil Nadu. These are used not only for entertainment but also communicate important messages to the community. 11.5 Reﬂ ection of Light g When the opaque object was a shiny object like a polished steel plate, I got a shadow on the screen, but I also saw that there was a bright spot of light on the wall on the opposite side.

What can you do to redirect light on the wall on which the sunlight is not falling directly? Curiosity | Textbook of Science | Grade 7 160 What conclusion do you draw from your observations? This activity suggests that a shiny surface or a mirror changes the direction of light that falls upon it. This change in direction of light by a mirror is called the reﬂ ection of light. Let us try to understand the reﬂ ection of light by a mirror. Activity 11.6: Let us experiment Fig. 11.8: Using mirror to redirect sunlight on a wall Turn the shiny plate or mirror in diﬀ erent directions to redirect the light onto a wall or a nearby surface (Fig. 11.8). Do you see a spot of light on the wall? Does it mean that the shiny plate or mirror has changed the direction of light? Now, tilt the shiny plate or mirror in diﬀ erent ways and observe the light spot on the wall. Does it change position? Notice how light always travels in straight lines and changes direction when it falls on the shiny plate or mirror. Take a plane mirror with stand, a torch, a comb, a sheet of white paper, and a strip of black paper. Using the black paper, close all openings of the comb, except for one to make a thin slit. Spread a white paper on a table, hold the comb perpendicular to the sheet of paper and shine the torch light on the slit.

Adjust the comb and torch slightly till you see a thin beam of light along the paper which has passed through the slit (Fig. 11.9a). Now, place the mirror in the path of the light beam while keeping the comb steady (Fig. 11.9b). What do you observe? The path of the light beam is changed after falling on the mirror. The reﬂ ection of light occurs at the mirror. mirror. In a mirror, I can also see my face.

The image formed by a plane mirror is of the same size as the object. Again, move the pen to diﬀ erent positions in front of the mirror and observe if the image is upright at each position. Does the tip of the pen appear on top at each position? An upright image is called erect. An image formed by a plane mirror is erect. Now, place a screen vertically behind the mirror. Move it around. Do you get the image on the screen? Repeat this by placing the screen in front of the mirror. The image formed by a plane mirror cannot be obtained on a screen.

The image appears to be far from the mirror when you stand far from the plane mirror. Raise your left arm. Which arm does your image raise? Touch your right ear. Which ear does your image touch? You ﬁ nd that your left appears right in your image and your right appears left in your image. This type of perceived left-right reversal is called lateral inversion. There is lateral inversion in the images formed by a plane mirror. Oh! Now I realise why ‘ ̓ is written on an ambulance.

Rashmika had been noticing that the coconut tree shadows were long in the morning but shorter in the afternoon on her way back. She thought about it and decided that the size of the shadows changed because the Sun moved across the sky during the day. But she also remembered learning that the Earth moved around the Sun (in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity) so she was puzzled. She wondered — does the Sun move in the sky? Or does the Earth move? Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 7 170 12.1 Rotation of the Earth You might have also noticed that the Sun rises in the East and sets in the West. Have you ever wondered why? Let us try to understand why. Have you ever enjoyed riding a merry-go-round at a park or at your school? Let us go back to riding a merry-go-round!

In which direction do you ﬁ nd the tree turning around you? Is it in your view all the time? The tree appears to turn around you in the opposite direction, that is, the clockwise direction. The tree appears in your view from your left-hand side and then moves out of your view on the right-hand side when you view it from a merry-go-round turning around in anti-clockwise direction. Using the observations made by us while riding a merry-go- round, let us now think. When we view from the Earth, the Sun appears in the East, moves across the sky from the East to the West and disappears in the West. Does it indicate that the Sun is moving in the sky? Or might it be that the Earth itself is turning around and the Sun just appears to move? The fact is that the Sun appears to be moving because we view it from the Earth, which is turning around itself. Earth, Moon, and the Sun 171 In which way is the Earth turning around itself? To visualise this, let us recall some of the objects which turn around themselves. Have you watched a top spinning around its spindle (Fig. 12.2a)? Or a spinning fan (Fig. 12.2b)?

The Earth’s axis of rotation passes through its geographic North Pole and the South Pole. The Earth completes one rotation in about 24 hours. When viewed from the top of the North Pole (Fig. 12.3), the Earth is rotating in the anti-clockwise direction, that is, from West to East. Let us try to understand this with the help of a globe.

FASCINATING FACTS In an earlier chapter ‘Measurement of Time and Motion’, you learnt how the scientist Galileo discovered an important property of a pendulum, and in the seventeenth century, another scientist, Huygens, used that property to make pendulum clocks that measured time. In the middle of nineteenth century, another scientist, Leon Foucault, used a long pendulum to give the ﬁ rst simple demonstration of the Earth’s rotation. The pendulum, known as a Foucault pendulum in his honour, consists of a long string with a heavy bob, suspended from a high ceiling. A Foucault pendulum with a length of 22 metres has been hung from a skylight in the Constitution Hall of the new Parliament building in New Delhi, India. It symbolises the integration of the idea of India with the vastness of the cosmos. p ho su ha Ha In In Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 7 174 Yes, indeed!

Mark the time of your observation along with your sketch as shown in Fig. 12.7. After two hours, observe the Big Dipper again. Has it moved? Again, draw its orientation and note down the time. Repeat the above step after two hours. Do you observe that the Big Dipper appears to move around the Pole Star (notice just the movement even if you cannot see the Pole Star)? The Earth’s axis of rotation points very close to the Pole Star in the Northern Hemisphere. Therefore, the Pole Star appears nearly stationary in the sky from the Earth. All the stars appear to move around it. Just like the Sun, the Moon also appears to rise in the eastward direction and set in the westward direction because the Earth rotates from West to East.

Earth, Moon, and the Sun 175 FASCINATING FACTS Ancient Indian astronomers, including Aryabhata, had also noticed the daily apparent motion of the celestial objects, such as the Sun, Moon, planets and stars. Aryabhata was a famous mathematician and astronomer of ancient India who wrote an important treatise, Aryabhatiya, around the ﬁ fth century CE. The apparent motion of the stars due to the rotation of the Earth is explained in Verse 9, Golapada, Aryabhatiya. ¥ÙéÜæð×»çÌÙæñüSÍÑ ÂàØˆØ¿Ü¢ çßÜæð×»¢ ØmÌ÷ïÐ ¥¿ÜæçÙ ÖæçÙ ÌmÌ÷ï â×Âçp×»æçÙ ÜVæØæ×÷ïH Just as a man in a boat moving forward sees stationary objects as moving backwards, so also the stars that are stationary are seen by people of Lanka as moving towards the west. Aryabhata’s stated value for the time taken by the Earth to complete one full rotation about its axis is around 23 hours 56 minutes 4.1 seconds (in modern units). This value is impressively close to the currently accepted value. I have seen that the stars and constellations that appear in the East at sunset change during diﬀ erent months. Yes. Maybe that is why we were told to look for certain stars and constellations at certain times of the year in Grade 6. But, why do diﬀ erent stars appear in the night sky over the course of a year? 12.2 Revolution of the Earth While rotating on its own axis, the Earth also revolves around the Sun as we learnt in Grade 6.

This movement is diﬀ erent from rotation. Revolution is the motion of an object around another object. Curiosity Textbook of Science Grade 7 176 The path an object takes while revolving around another object is called its orbit. If viewed from the top (Fig. 12.8), the orbit of the Earth around the Sun is nearly circular. (In the ﬁ gure of the Solar System given in chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in the Grade 6 Science textbook Curiosity, the orbit appeared elongated because it was a side view of the orbit). The Earth completes one revolution around the Sun in about 365 days and 6 hours. 12.2.1 Changing view of night sky from the Earth Every evening the Sun sets in the westward direction and the night sky becomes visible. We know that this occurs due to the Earth’s rotation. As the Earth also revolves around the Sun continuously, the stars seen in the night sky after sunset gradually change over a year as we look in diﬀ erent directions, as shown in Fig. 12.8.

Earth, Moon, and the Sun 177 12.2.2 Seasons on the Earth I have noticed that we go through a cycle of seasons every year. Is it related to the revolution of the Earth around the Sun in some way? I have also noticed that days are longer in summer than in winter. The Earth’s axis of rotation is not upright with respect to the orbit, but is tilted. The Earth maintains this tilt as it orbits around the Sun (Fig. 12.9). The tilt of the Earth’s axis and the spherical shape of the Earth gives rise to seasons. Let us ﬁ nd out, how.

As seen in Fig. 12.10a, a given amount of sunrays are spread in a smaller area in the Northern Hemisphere as compared to the Southern Hemisphere due to the spherical shape of the Earth’s surface. So that area is heated more. Further, the Northern Hemisphere receives sunlight for more than 12 hours in June (Fig. 12.11a). So, the Northern Hemisphere experiences more intense sunlight, which lasts for a longer time, causing the summer season. In December, the situation is opposite in the Northern Hemisphere and it experiences winter season with sunlight for shorter time (Fig. 12.10b and Fig. 12.11b).

June December (a) (b) The seasons and length of daytime are reversed in the Southern Hemisphere as compared to the Northern Hemisphere. There, it is winter in June and summer in December (Fig. 12.10 and Fig. 12.11). Two incorrect reasons often given to explain why seasons occur on the Earth are: When the Northern Hemisphere tilts towards the Sun, it is closer to the Sun. The orbit of the Earth is an oval with the Sun slightly displaced from its centre so the Earth is at diﬀ erent distances from the Sun over the year. However, the diﬀ erence in distances in either of these cases is very small and these are not the reasons why seasons occur on the Earth. In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January. DIVE EEPER o   H DIVE EEPER Sunrays Earth, Moon, and the Sun 179 In the Northern Hemisphere, the longest day occurs around 21 June—this is known as summer solstice. After the summer solstice, the duration of a day becomes shorter while that of a night becomes longer. The shortest day and longest night in this Hemisphere occur around 22 December known as the winter solstice. Around 21 March and 23 September, the daytime lasts for 12 hours.

The South Pole experiences the opposite behaviour. The polar regions thus experience continuous sunshine for six months followed by a six-month period of darkness. F A d T b s On the equator, there is always 12 hours of sunlight and 12 hours of darkness. There is little diﬀ erence in the intensity of the sunrays falling on the equator in diﬀ erent months. Thus, for the southern states of India that lie close to the equator, the eﬀ ect of seasons is not very prominent. Other eﬀ ects, such as local geographical features and proximity to oceans or seas, can also inﬂ uence these broader patterns seen in the two hemispheres, as you have learnt in social science. 12.3 Eclipses p Day and night cycle, seasons, the life on the Earth... so much is dependent upon the Sun. Could the light from the Sun get blocked by the two planets which are revolving between the Earth and the Sun? The planets Mercury and Venus appear very small compared to the Sun, and never block the entire light from the Sun reaching us. However, you may be surprised to know that the Moon can do that.

This is known as a solar eclipse. You may wonder how the Moon, which is smaller than the Sun, blocks the light coming from the Sun that we see in the sky. Activity 12.4: Let us explore Ask your friend to stand in front of you at a distance of about 5 metres. Consider his head to be the Sun. Now close one eye and show a thumbs up with your outstretched hand towards your friend as shown in Fig. 12.12. Are you able to cover the entire head of your friend with your thumb? You can cover the entire head of your friend with the help of your thumb, even though your thumb is much smaller than the actual size of your friend’s head. How could it be? The size of any object as seen by your eye — also known as apparent size — depends upon both its actual physical size and its distance from you. The thumb being much closer to you as compared to your friend, the apparent sizes of your thumb and your friend’s head as seen by you in Activity 12.4 are similar. The apparent sizes of the Moon and the Sun in the sky are similar when viewed from the Earth. This is so because though the Moon is much smaller in physical size than the Sun, the Moon is much closer to us compared to the Sun.

Though the planets Mercury and Venus are much larger than the Moon in size, they are also much farther from the Earth as compared to the Moon. Thus, their apparent sizes are very much smaller than the Sun and they cannot block the Sun. For example, when Venus passes between the Sun and the Earth, it appears as a tiny black dot passing against the bright face of the Sun. This event, known as a Transit of Venus, is a rare event.

During a total solar eclipse, for a few minutes it turns dark during the day as no sunlight reaches the Earth. Due to the Earth’s rotation and the motion of the Moon in its orbit, the Moon’s shadow moves across the surface of the Earth. Thus, the total solar eclipse is visible only for a few minutes. As the Moon begins to move away from the front of the Sun (Fig. 12.14c), we see a partial solar eclipse and daylight begins to return. Safe Viewing of a Solar Eclipse Caution— During a solar eclipse, one might be tempted to look at the Sun, thinking that it wouldn’t be strong enough to cause harm to our eyes. However, even during the eclipse, the Sun is intense enough to damage the eyes and cause blindness. Thus, directly viewing solar eclipse must be strictly avoided. Also, do not view it through sunglasses, binoculars, or telescopes. Usually, astronomy organisations, such as planetaria and astronomy clubs hold eclipse viewing events during a solar eclipse (Fig. 12.15). Participating in such events is the best way to observe a solar eclipse since the organisers not only provide specialised eye protection for solar viewing, but also oﬀ er scientiﬁ c explanations.

A mirror can be used to project an image of the Sun onto a wall. However, holding it at the correct angle throughout a solar eclipse can be diﬃ cult. To solve this, make a movable stand for the mirror. Use a hollow ball with a small hole, half-ﬁ ll it with sand (to keep it stable), and attach a small mirror (such as an embroidery mirror) to it. Place the ball on a circular ring, like an adhesive tape ring, so it can be turned around easily. Adjust it until the Sun’s image appears on a wall or screen. Fig. 12.15 shows this set-up where the mirror is ﬁ xed to a green ball. Caution — This activity should be performed strictly under supervision of a teacher. Take care not to direct the reﬂ ected light beam in anyone’s eyes. r e e e l DIVE EEPER People have observed eclipses and maintained records since ancient times. When the reasons for eclipses were not known, they feared the occurrence of eclipses. As you can imagine, something blocking the Sun, the main source of heat and light on the Earth, even for a brief period of time, would have been extremely concerning.

At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It aims to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India— to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy’s role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among the other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training (NCERT), on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups (CAGs), which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. Ganita Prakash, the textbook of mathematics for Grade 8 (Part 1) is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with NEP 2020 and NCF-SE 2023, the textbook continues to foster the spirit of experiential and inquiry-based learning, a spirit already introduced in the mathematics textbooks for Grades 6 and 7. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, and understand concepts of mathematics through real-world contexts. iv The textbook makes efforts to encourage the students to observe and explore patterns around them and discover mathematical concepts on their own. The content is structured in a way that supports a joyful and progressive understanding of increasingly complex concepts, easing students into more advanced learning. The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas, such as Science, Social Science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS)."}

The content attempts to integrate mathematics with other subject areas, such as Science, Social Science with cross-cutting themes like environmental education, value education, inclusive education, and Indian Knowledge Systems (IKS). At most of the places the concept begins with either a story or a puzzle that not only makes students think but also feels the importance of the concept. However, in addition to this textbook, students at this stage should also be encouraged to explore various other learning resources. School libraries play a crucial role in making such resources available. Besides, the role of parents and teachers will also be invaluable in guiding and encouraging students to do so. With this, I express my gratitude to all those who have been involved in the development of this textbook, and hope that it will meet the expectations of all stakeholders. At the same time, I also invite suggestions and feedback from all its users for further improvement in the coming years. \b Dinesh Prasad Saklani \b Director New Delhi\b National Council of Educational June 2025\b Research and Training ABOUT THE BOOK Mathematics helps students develop not only basic arithmetic skills, but also the crucial capacities of logical reasoning, creative problem-solving, and clear and precise communication (both oral and written).

Learning Mathematics contributes to the development of capacities to make informed choices and decisions. Understanding numbers and quantitative arguments is necessary for effective and meaningful democratic and economic participation. Mathematics thus plays an important role in achieving the overall aims of school education. Mathematics at the Middle Stage is a major challenge and performs the dual role of being both close to the experience and environment of a learner and being abstract. It performs the role of developing intuition, while also maintaining and emphasising rigour. It is enhancing critical and logical thinking, while also developing artistry and creativity, and a sense of elegance and aesthetics. Mathematics provides students with plenty of opportunities to explore and discover concepts on their own while also teaching the best-known methods in the global repertoire of mathematics. This textbook attempts to address the goals and challenges of learning mathematics. The writers have aimed to strike a judicious balance between informal and formal definitions and methods in helping students to develop both intuition and rigour. The textbook also provides numerous opportunities for student-student and student–teacher interaction in the classroom to promote active and experiential learning. A number of questions, puzzles, and interactive exercises are posed throughout the textbook to encourage constant exploration. Many of the questions are open-ended to stimulate classroom discussion. The Chapter 1: ‘A Square and A Cube’ is an introduction to the special types of numbers called squares and cubes through engaging explorations, and contexts. Chapter 2: ‘Power Play’ considers short and logical ways of expressing very large numbers, and discusses how they can be written and read without ambiguity. Chapter 3: ‘A Story of Numbers’ reveals how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across different places in the world,"}

Chapter 3: ‘A Story of Numbers’ reveals how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across different places in the world, to finally reach its modern efficient form. Chapter 4: ‘Quadrilaterals’ discusses some interesting types of four-sided figures and problems based on them. Chapter 5: ‘Number Play’ shows different properties of numbers studied by the students with a balance of engaging activities vi through visualisation and rigorous mathematical reasoning. Chapter 6: ‘We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply’ covers aspects related to Algebra, and in particular, the distributive law. Chapter 7: ‘Proportional Reasoning’ explores a new way to compare two quantities using daily life situations. In all the chapters, an attempt has been made to emphasise connections with other subjects including Art, History and Science. By weaving storytelling and hands-on activities together, as done in Grades 6 and 7, we hope that an immersive learning experience will be created that ignites curiosity and fosters a love for mathematics. It is hoped that teachers would give students the opportunity to discuss, play, engage with each other and provide logical arguments for different ideas, and find loopholes in arguments presented. This is necessary for the learners to eventually develop the ability to understand what it means to prove something and also become confident about the underlying concepts. The mathematics classroom should not expect a blind application of algorithms but should rather encourage students to find many different ways to solve problems.

Indian rootedness has also been kept in mind while giving contexts for different concepts. The contributions of Indian mathematicians have also been given as part of a problem-solving approach to make students aware of India’s rich mathematical heritage and its global contributions to mathematics. The concepts and problems in this textbook are related to daily life situations. An attempt has been made to use contexts and materials that students are familiar with. Learning material sheets have been given at the back of the book that may be photocopied and used in the classroom. Exercises or activities are often given to encourage peer group efforts and discussions. However, this textbook intends to address the learning needs of a diverse group of students in the classroom. We have tried to link concepts learnt in initial chapters with ideas in subsequent chapters, to show the connectedness and unity of mathematics. We hope that teachers can revise these concepts in a spiralling way so that students are able to appreciate the entire conceptual structure of mathematics. We hope that teachers may focus more on the ideas of squares and cubes, exponents, evolution of numbers and other notions that are new to the students, and are foundational for further learning.

NOTE TO THE TEACHER We hope that this book, Ganita Prakash, will serve as a strong support and guide to you in achieving the exciting task that you have before you: that of passing on the joy of learning the beautiful subject of Mathematics to the next generation. This task calls for providing a fertile environment that allows for the flowering of mathematical thinking in the minds of students. Classrooms,where students just listen and write down whatever is being told to them or written on the board, are deficient in the conditions required for learning mathematics. Instead, classrooms need to be places where students are engaged in playing with mathematical concepts, finding and discussing patterns, and developing creative strategies together to solve problems. Students should also be posing problems to each other and discussing possible solutions with each other. In fact, these are the very conditions that have led to the development of the entire field of mathematics so far, and so one cannot expect students to pick up mathematical thinking and understanding without these conditions. Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem,"}

Fortunately, it is not difficult to create such conditions in the classroom. It just requires an interesting question, problem, pattern, or challenge to be thrown open to the students on a regular basis, and sufficient time to be given to them to play with, discuss, and work on it as a class or in pairs or groups. Along with it, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. While creating the spark for initiating mathematical thinking in classrooms is not difficult, sustaining it may be challenging and may involve efforts from your side. Nevertheless, even if just the first part of throwing open a question, problem, pattern, or challenge is done at least once or twice a week, accompanied by sufficient waiting time from your side for students to play, discuss, and work on it, it can have a great positive impact on how the students view and approach mathematics. It should be noted that this positive impact will not happen overnight. That takes time and depends on various factors such as the number of opportunities you give for problem solving, your patience, and the encouragement you give to the students. To support you in posing problems, all the problems or questions in this book are marked using the icons and .

You will find some of the problems labelled ‘ Math Talk ’. Such questions can especially be made as topics for classroom discussion. xii An owl mascot appears at various points in the textbook to highlight important mathematical processes, ways of thinking, and problem- solving approaches. These can be brought out during classroom discussions, both where the owl is present and also in other similar situations. In this grade, justification/proofs of mathematical statements find an increased presence. Students should be gently encouraged to deduce properties and not be forced to do it. Whenever students face challenges in doing it, encourage them to experiment and observe, and use their intuition in figuring out properties. Providing justification/ proof is a skill that takes time to develop. To develop students’ mathematical thinking and understanding of concepts, a sufficient number of problems are given. Trying to ‘cover’ all of them must not happen at the cost of students not getting to spend quality time on playing with and discussing them. It is important to understand that the exploratory problems are not only for promoting problem solving skills; they also serve in strengthening procedural fluency when children start engaging in exploration. Efforts must be made in making students independent learners. One essential aspect required for this is an ability to read and understand mathematical text. To promote this skill, students should be encouraged to read the book by themselves and in groups. Give opportunities to them to interpret what they read and express it to others.

It is important to routinely pose new problems, questions, patterns, or challenges to the students and give them sufficient time to play with, discuss, and work on them, individually and in groups. 2. During this time, an environment that accepts mistakes and acknowledges their importance in learning needs to be nurtured. 3. There should be a culture where students pose problems to each other and discuss with each other various ways to approach the problems. About the Problems in the Book 1. The exploratory problems in the book not only promote problem solving; they also aim to strengthen procedural fluency when students start engaging in exploration. 2.

Her son Khoisnam and their 99 relatives were invited to the reading of her will. She wanted to leave all of her ratnas to her son, but she knew that if she did so, all their relatives would pester Khoisnam forever. She hoped that she had taught him everything he needed to know about solving puzzles. She left the following note in her will— “I have created a puzzle. If all 100 of you answer it at the same time, you will share the ratnas equally. However, if you are the first one to solve the problem, you will get to keep the entire inheritance to yourself. Good luck.” The minister took Khoisnam and his 99 relatives to a secret room in the mansion containing 100 lockers. The minister explained— “Each person is assigned a number from 1 to 100. • Person 1 opens every locker. • \u0007Person 2 toggles every 2nd locker (i.e., closes it if it is open, opens it if it is closed). • Person 3 toggles every 3rd locker (3rd, 6th, 9th, … and so on). • Person 4 toggles every 4th locker (4th, 8th, 12th, … and so on). This continues until all 100 get their turn. In the end, only some lockers remain open. The open lockers reveal the code to the fortune in the safe.” Before the process begins, Khoisnam realises that he already knows which lockers will be open at the end. How did he figure out the answer? Hint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled."}

How did he figure out the answer? Hint: Find out how many times each locker is toggled. A SQUARE AND A CUBE 1 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 2 If a locker is toggled an odd number of times, it will be open. Otherwise, it will be closed. The number of times a locker is toggled is the same as the number of factors of the locker number. For example, for locker #6, Person 1 opens it, Person 2 closes it, Person 3 opens it and Person 6 closes it. The numbers 1, 2, 3, and 6 are factors of 6. If the number of factors is even, the locker will be toggled by an even number of people and it will eventually be closed. Note that each factor of a number has a ‛partner factor’ so that the product of the pair of factors yields the given number. Here, 1 and 6 form a pair of partner factors of 6, and 2 and 3 form another pair. Does every number have an even number of factors? We see in some cases, like 2 × 2, that the numbers in the pair are the same. Can you use this insight to find more numbers with an odd number of factors? For instance, 36 has a factor pair 6 × 6 where both numbers are 6. Does this number have an odd number of factors? If every factor of 36 other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true."}

If every factor of 36 other than 6 has a different factor as its partner, then we can be sure that 36 has an odd number of factors. Check if this is true. Hence all the following numbers have an odd number of factors — 1 × 1, 2 × 2, 3 × 3, 4 × 4, ... A number that can be expressed as the product of a number with itself is called a square number, or simply a square. The only numbers that have an odd number of factors are the squares, because they each have one factor which, when multiplied by itself, equals the number. Therefore, every locker whose number is a square will remain open. 6: 1 × 6 2 × 3 Factors are 1, 2, 3 and 6. 1: 1 × 1 The only factor is 1. 4: 1 × 4 2 × 2 Factors are 1, 2 and 4. 9: 1 × 9 3 × 3 Factors are 1, 3 and 9.

We know that the number of unit squares in a square (the area of a square) is the product of its sides. The table below gives the areas of squares with different sides.

In general, for any number n, we write n × n = n2, which is read as ‛n squared’. Can we have a square of sidelength 3 5 or 2.5 units? Yes, there area in square units are ( 3 5) 2 = ( 3 5) × ( 3 5) = ( 9 25), and (2.5) 2 = (2.5) × (2.5) = 6.25. Khoisnam immediately collects word clues from these 10 lockers and reads, “The passcode consists of the first five locker numbers that were touched exactly twice.” Which are these five lockers? The lockers that are toggled twice are the prime numbers, since each prime number has 1 and the number itself as factors. So, the code is 2-3-5-7-11.

Share your observations and make conjectures. Study the squares in the table above. What are the digits in the units places of these numbers? All these numbers end with 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9. None of them end with 2, 3, 7 or 8. If a number ends in 0, 1, 4, 5, 6 or 9, is it always a square? The numbers 16 and 36 are both squares with 6 in the units place. However, 26, whose units digit is also 6, is not a square. Therefore, we cannot determine if a number is a square just by looking at the digit in the units place. But, the units digit can tell us when a number is not a square. If a number ends with 2, 3, 7, or 8, then we can definitely say that it is not a square. Write 5 numbers such that you can determine by looking at their units digit that they are not squares. The squares, 12, 92, 112, 192, 212, and 292, all have 1 in their units place. Write the next two squares. Notice that if a number has 1 or 9 in the units place, then its square ends in 1. Let us consider square numbers ending in 6: 16 = 42, 36 = 62, 196 = 142, 256 = 162, 576 = 242, and 676 = 262. Math Talk Math"}

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 6 Do you remember this pattern from Grade 6? The picture below explains why each subsequent inverted L gives the next odd number: We see that the sum of the first n odd numbers is n2. Alternatively, every square is a sum of successive odd numbers starting from 1. Also, we can find out whether a number is a perfect square by successively subtracting odd numbers. Consider the number 25, successively subtract 1, 3, 5, ... until you get or cross over 0, This means 25 = 1 + 3 + 5 + 7 + 9 and is thus a perfect square. Since we subtracted the first five odd numbers, 25 = 52. Using the pattern above, find 362, given that 352 = 1225. From the question we know that 1225 is the sum of the first 35 odd numbers. To find 362, we need to add the 36th odd number to 1225. How do we find the 36th odd number? The 1st odd number is 1, 2nd odd number is 3, 3rd number is 5, …, 6th odd number is 11 and so on. What is the nth odd number? The nth odd number is 2n–1. Therefore, the 36th odd number is 71. By adding 71"}

Given a number, such as 576 or 327, how do we find out if it is a perfect square? If it is a perfect square, how can we find its square root? We know that perfect squares end in 1, 4, 9, 6, 5, or an even number of zeros. But, it is not certain that a number that satisfies this condition is a square. We can clearly say that 327 is not a perfect square. However, we cannot be sure that 576 is a perfect square. 1. We can list all the square numbers in sequence and find out whether 576 occurs among them. We know that 202 = 400, we can find squares of 21, 22, 23, … and so on until we get 576 or a number greater than 576. 202 = 400 212 = 441 222 = 484 232 = 529 242 = 576 \u0007However, this process becomes inefficient for larger numbers. 2.

We know that a perfect square is obtained by multiplying an integer by itself. Will looking at a number’s prime factorisation help in determining whether it is a perfect square? \u0007 Yes, if we can divide the prime factors of a number into two equal groups, then the product of the prime factors in either group combine to form the square root. Is 324 a perfect square? 324 = 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 3 × 3. These can be grouped as 324 = (2 × 3 × 3) × (2 × 3 × 3). = (2 × 3 × 3)2 = 182. We can also write the prime factors in pairs. That is, 324 = (2 × 2) × (3 × 3) × (3 × 3), which shows that 324 is a perfect square. Thus, 324 = (2×3×3)2 = 182. Therefore, 324 =18. Is 156 a perfect square?

We can estimate the square root of larger perfect squares by looking at the closest perfect squares we are familiar with and then narrowing down the interval to search. For example, to find 1936 , we can reason as follows: (i) 1936 is between 1600 (402) and 2500 (502), so 40 < 1936 < 50. (ii) The last digit of 1936 is 6. So, the last digit of the square root must either be 4 or 6. It can be 44 or 46. (iii) If we calculate 452, we can compare it with 1936 to halve the interval to search from 40–50 to either 40–45 or 45–50. We can write 452 as (40 + 5) (40 + 5) = 402 + 2 × 40 × 5 + 52 = 1600 + 400 + 25 = 2025. (iv) 2025 > 1936. So, 40 < 1936 < 45 (v) From the observation in point b we can guess and then verify that 1936 is 44. Consider the following situations — Aribam and Bijou play a game.

The game goes on till Aribam says 250. Bijou is not able to answer because 250 is not a perfect square. Aribam asks Bijou if he can at least provide a number that is close to the square root of 250. For this, Bijou needs to estimate the square root of 250. We know that 100 < 250 < 400 and 100 = 10 and 400 = 20. So, 10 < 250 < 20. But, we are still not very close to the number whose square is 250. We know that 152 = 225 and 162 = 256. Therefore, 15 < 250 < 16. Since 256 is much closer to 250 than 225, 250 is approximately 16. We also know it is less than 16. Here is another problem that requires estimating square roots. Akhil has a square piece of cloth of area 125 cm2. He wants to know if he can cut out a square handkerchief of side 15 cm. If not, he wants to know the maximum size handkerchief that can be cut out from this piece of cloth with an integer side length. 125 is not a perfect square. The nearest perfect squares are 112 = 121 and 122 = 144. So the largest square handkerchief with integer side length that can be cut out from this piece of cloth has side length 11 cm.

H. Hardy at the University of Cambridge, Hardy had come to visit Ramanujan at a hospital when he was ill. Hardy had ridden in a taxicab numbered 1729 and he remarked that 1729 was ‘rather a dull number,’ adding that he hoped that this was not a bad sign. Ramanujan immediately replied, “No, Hardy, it is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways”. 1729 = 13 + 123 = 93 + 103. Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy– Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed"}

Because of this story, 1729 has since been known as the Hardy– Ramanujan Number. And numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two cubes in two different ways are called taxicab numbers. The next two taxicab numbers after 1729 are 4104 and 13832. Find the two ways in which each of these can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes. How did Ramanujan know this? Well, he loved numbers. All through his life, he tinkered with numbers. During Ramanujan’s time in Cambridge, his colleagues often marveled at his ability to see deep patterns in numbers that seemed arbitrary to others. His colleague, John Littlewood, once said, “Every positive integer was one of his [Ramanujan's] personal friends”. Try This Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 14 Perfect Cubes and Consecutive Odd Numbers Consecutive odd numbers have a role to play with cubes too.

Let us check if 3375 is a perfect cube. 3375 = 3 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 5 × 5. Can the factors be split into three identical groups? For 3375, we can form three groups of (3 × 5). So, 3375 = (3 × 5) × (3 × 5) × (3 × 5) = (3 × 5)3 = 153. Another way is to check if the factors can be grouped into triplet(s): 3375 = (3 × 3 × 3) × (5 × 5 × 5) = 33 × 53. This means 3375 15 3 = . Is 500 a perfect cube? 500 = 2 × 2 × 5 × 5 × 5. We see that the factors cannot be split into three identical groups. Therefore, 500 is not a perfect cube.

In ancient Sanskrit works the term varga was used both for the square figure or its area, as well as the square power, and the term ghana was used both for the solid cube as well as the product of a number with itself three times. The fourth power was called varga-varga . These terms were used in India at least from the third century BCE. Aryabhata (499 CE) states “A square figure of four equal sides and the number representing its area are called varga. The product of two equal quantities is also called varga.” Thus, the term varga for square power has its origin in the graphical representation of a square figure. Why is the word ‘root’ (the root of a plant) used for the mathematical operation √ (square root, cube root, etc.)? It is because, in ancient India, the Sanskrit word mula, meaning root of a plant, basis, cause, origin, etc., was used for the mathematical operations of taking roots. In Sanskrit, varga-mula (the basis, cause, origin of the square) was used for square-root and ghana-mula was used for cube-root.

For each cap, he can choose any of the 4 dresses, so for 3 caps, 4 + 4 + 4 = 4 × 3 = 12 combinations are possible.

As the number of digits increases, it becomes difficult to read the numbers correctly. We may miscount the number of zeroes or place commas incorrectly. We will then read the wrong value. It is like getting ₹5,000 when you were supposed to get ₹50,000. The number of zeroes is more important than the initial digits in several cases. Can we use the exponential notation to simplify and read these very large numbers correctly? For example, the number 5900 can be expressed as — 5900 = 590 × 10 = 590 × 101 = 59 × 100 = 59 × 102 = 5.9 × 1000 = 5.9 × 103 = 0.59 × 10000 = 0.59 × 104.

Therefore, the standard form explicitly mentions the exponent, which indicates the number of digits. If we say that the population of Kohima is 1,42,395, then it gives the impression that we are quite sure about this number up to the units place. When we use large numbers, in most cases, we are more concerned about how big a quantity or measure is, rather than the exact value. If we are only sure that the population is around 1 lakh 42 thousand, we can write it as 1.42 × 105. If we can only be certain that it is around 1 lakh 40 thousand, we write it as 1.4 × 105.

Would the number of coins be in hundreds, thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? Make an instinctive guess. Find the answer by making necessary and reasonable assumptions and approximations for the unknowns. Remember, we are not looking for an exact answer but a reasonably close estimate.

Estu asks, “What if we use 5-rupee coins or 10-rupee notes instead? How much money could it be?” Make an instinctive guess first. Then find out (make necessary and reasonable assumptions about the unknown details and find the answers). Estu says, “When I become an adult, I would like to donate notebooks worth my weight every year”. Roxie says, “When I grow up, I would like to do annadāna (offering grains or meals) worth my weight every year”. How many people might benefit from each of these offerings in a year? Again, guess first before finding out. Roxie and Estu overheard someone saying — “We did pādayātra for about 400 km to reach this place! We arrived early this morning.” How long ago would they have started their journey? Find answers by making necessary assumptions and approximations. Do guess first before calculating to check how close your guess was! How about measuring to find out the weight of a 1-rupee coin? Initially, your guesses may be very far off from the answer and it is perfectly fine! You will get better at it like as you do it often and in different situations. Guessing and estimating can build intuition about numbers and various quantities.

Power Play 35 Before the rise of modern transport, people moved from one place to another by walking — sometimes merchants, sages, and scholars walked thousands of kilometres to different parts of the world across deserts, mountains, and rivers. How many times can a person circumnavigate (go around the world) the Earth in their lifetime if they walk non-stop? Consider the distance around the Earth as 40,000 km. Linear Growth vs. Exponential Growth Roxie tells Estu about a science-fiction novel she is reading where they build a ladder to reach the moon, “... I wonder if we actually had a ladder like that, how many steps would it have?”. What do you think? Make an instinctive guess first. Would the number of steps be in thousands, lakhs, crores, or even more? To find out, we would need to know the gap between consecutive steps of the ladder. Let’s assume a reasonable distance of 20 cm. Visualising the problem as shown, Pādayātra, is the traditional practice of walking long distances as part of a religious or spiritual pursuit. People across religions in our country observe similar forms of pilgrimage or spiritual walking, although they may have different names or purposes. Some of the pilgrimages are Ajmer Sharif Dargah Ziyarat, Pandharpur Wari, Kānwar Yatra, Sabarimala Yatra, Sammed Shikharji Yatra, Lumbini to Sarnath Yatra.

If we calculate the value, we get the result as 1,92,20,00,000 steps, which is 192 crore and 20 lakh steps or 1 billion 922 million steps. The fixed increase in the distance from the earth with each step (a 20 cm gain after each step) is called linear growth. To cover the distance between the Earth and the Moon, it takes 1,92,20,00,000 steps with linear growth whereas it takes just 46 folds of a piece of paper with exponential growth! Linear growth is additive, whereas exponential growth is multiplicative. 20 + 20 + 20 + ………… 1,92,20,00,000 times 0.001 × 2 × 2 × 2 ………. 46 times Some examples of exponential growth we have seen earlier in this chapter are ‘The Stones that Shine’, ‘Magical Pond’, ‘How Many Combinations’.

SUMMARY Tremendous in Ten! Find a partner to play this game with. In 10 seconds, the person who writes a number or an expression, using only the digits 0 - 9 and arithmetic operations, that gives a number that is the larger between the two wins the round. In Round 1, Roxie wrote 10000000000000 and Estu wrote 999999 × 999999. Between these two, Roxie’s number is greater. Can you see why? Roxie’s number is 1013, whereas Estu’s number is less than (106) 2. In Round 2, Roxie wrote 101000 + 101000 + 101000 + 101000 and Estu wrote (101000000) × 9000. Can you say which is greater?

She picked it up and stared at the strange symbols all over it. “What is this?” she wondered. She ran to her father, holding the paper as if it were a secret treasure. He looked at it and smiled. “Around 4000 years ago, there flourished a civilisation in a region called Mesopotamia, in the western part of Asia, containing a major part of the present-day Iraq and a few other neighbouring countries. This is one of the ways they wrote their numbers!” Reema’s eyes lit up, “Seriously? These strange symbols were numbers?” Her curiosity was sparked, and questions started swirling in her head. Since when have humans been counting? What was their need for counting? What were they counting? Since when have people been writing numbers in the modern form? How would the Mesopotamians have written 20? 50? 100? A Story of Numbers 49 Sensing her curiosity, her father started telling her how the idea of number and number representation evolved over the course of time, across geographies, to finally reach its modern efficient form.

Get ready to travel back in time with them! Humans had the need to count even as early as the Stone Age. They were counting to determine the quantity of food they had, the number of animals in their livestock, details regarding trades of goods, the number of offerings given in rituals, etc. They also wanted to keep track of the passing days, e.g., to know and predict when important events such as the new moon, full moon, or onset of a season would occur. However, when they said or wrote down such numbers, they didn’t make use of the numbers that we use today. The structure of the modern oral and written numbers that we use today had its origin thousands of years ago in India. Ancient Indian texts, such as the Yajurveda Samhita, mentioned names of numbers based on powers of 10, almost as we say them orally today. For example, they listed names for the numbers one (eka), ten (dasha), hundred (shata), thousand (sahasra), ten thousand (āyuta), etc., all the way up to 1012 and beyond. The way we write our numbers today — using the digits 0 through 9 — also originated and were developed in India, around 2000 years ago. The first known instance of numbers being written using ten digits, including the digit 0 (which was then notated as a dot), occurs in the Bakhshali manuscript (c. 3rd century CE). Aryabhata (c. 499 CE) was the first mathematician to fully explain, and do elaborate scientific computations with the Indian system of 10 symbols.

The Indian number system was transmitted to the Arab world by around 800 CE. It was popularised in the Arab world by the great Persian mathematician Al-Khwārizmī (after whom the word ‘algorithm’ is named) through his book On the Calculation with Hindu Numerals (c. 825) and by the noted philosopher Al-Kindi through his work On the Use of the Hindu Numerals (c. 830). From the Arab world, the Hindu numerals were transmitted to Europe and to parts of Africa by around 1100 CE. Though Al-Khwārizmī’s work on calculation with Hindu numerals was translated into Latin, it was the Italian mathematician Fibonacci who around the year 1200 really made the case to Europe to adopt the Indian numerals. However, the Roman numerals were so ingrained in European thinking and writing at the time that the Indian numerals did not gain widespread use for several more centuries. But eventually, during the European Renaissance and by the 17th century, not adopting them became impossible or it would impede scientific progress.

Because European scholars learned the Indian numerals from the Arab world, they called them ‛Arabic numerals’ to reflect their European perspective. On the other hand, as noted above, Arab scholars, such as Al-Khwārizmī and Al-Kindi, called them ‛Hindu numerals’. During the period of European colonisation, the European term Arabic numbers became widely used. However, in recent years, this mistake is being corrected in many textbooks and documents around the world, including in Europe. The most commonly used terminologies for the numbers we use today are ‛Hindu numerals’, ‛Indian numerals’, and the transitional ‛Hindu-Arabic numerals’. It is worth noting that the word ‛Hindu’ here does not refer to a religion, but rather a geography/people from whom these numbers came. The shape of the digits 0, 1, 2, ..., 9 used to write numbers in the Indian number system today evolved over a period of time, as shown below: Evolution of the digits used in the Indian number system Prior to the global adoption of the Indian system of numerals, different groups of people used different methods of representing numbers.

But first, let us explore some of the foundational ideas needed to count and to determine the number of objects in a given collection. The Mechanism of Counting Imagine that we are living in the Stone Age, say, around ten thousand years ago. Suppose we have a herd of cows. Here are some natural questions that we might ask about our herd — Q1. \u0007How do we ensure that all cows have returned safely after grazing? Q2. Do we have fewer cows than our neighbour? Q3. \u0007If there are fewer, how many more cows would we need so that we have the same number of cows as our neighbour? We need to tackle these questions without the use of the number names or written numbers of the Hindu number system. How do we do it? Here are some possible methods. Method 1: We could tackle the questions by using pebbles, sticks or any object that is available in abundance. Let us choose sticks. For every cow in the herd, we could keep a stick. The final collection of sticks tells us the number of cows, which can be used to check if any cows have gone missing. Math Talk Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 52 This way of associating each cow with a stick, such that no two cows are associated or mapped to the same stick is called a one-to-one mapping. This mapping can then be used to come up with a way to represent numbers, as shown in the table. Number Its representation (using sticks) 1 2 3 4 5 . . . . . .

Method 2: Instead of objects, we could use a standard sequence of sounds or names. For example, we could use the sounds of the letters of any language. While counting, we could make a one-to-one mapping between the objects and the letters: that is, associate each object to be counted with a letter, following the letter-order. This mapping can then be used to come up with a way of verbally representing numbers. For example, we get the following number representation if we use English letters ‘a’ to ‘z’. Number Its representation (using sounds or names) 1 2 3 4 5 . . . 26 . . . a b c d e z A Story of Numbers 53 An obvious limitation of using only the letters of the English alphabet in this form is that it cannot be used to count collections having more than 26 objects. How many numbers can you represent in this way using the sounds of the letters of your language? Method 3: We could use a sequence of written symbols as follows. Do you see a way of extending this method to represent bigger numbers as well? How? From the discussion above, we see that for counting and finding the size of a collection, we need a standard sequence of objects, or names, or written symbols, that has a fixed order. Let us call this standard sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence,"}

Let us call this standard sequence a number system. A collection of objects can be counted by making a one-to-one mapping between them and the standard sequence, following the sequence order. Since there is no end to numbers, the challenge is to come up with an unending standard sequence/number system that is easy to count with. Using sticks gives an unending standard sequence/number system. However, it is not convenient to count larger collections, as we will need as many sticks as the number of objects being counted. Using the sounds of the letters of a language, as in Method 2, is convenient for the counting process but is not an unending standard sequence/number system. The standard sequence/number system given in Method 3 was actually the system used in Europe before it got replaced by the Hindu number system. It is called the Roman number system. It was widely used in Europe for centuries, and was convenient for many purposes, but had the similar drawback that one cannot write arbitrarily large numbers without introducing more and more symbols. We will learn more about this system of writing numbers later on.

Some groups of people had numbers represented both by physical objects as well as by names, while others like the Chinese had all three forms of representation. The symbols occurring in a written number system are called numerals. For example, 0, 1, 5, 36, 193, etc., are some of the numerals occurring in the Hindu number system. Numerals representing ‘smaller’ numbers always had names, and so a number system composed of written symbols always went hand in hand with a number system composed of names, as is the case with the modern-day Hindu system. Figure it Out 1. Suppose you are using the number system that uses sticks to represent numbers, as in Method 1. Without using either the number names or the numerals of the Hindu number system, give a method for adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing two numbers or two collections of sticks. 2.

Tally Marks on Bones and Other Surfaces One of the oldest methods of number representation is by making notches — marks cut on a surface such as a bone or a wall of a cave. These marks are also called tally marks. In this method, a mark is made for each object that is being counted. So the final collection of marks represents the total number of objects. This method is very similar to the method of using sticks to count (Method 1), except for the fact that a mark is made instead of adding a stick. Archaeologists have discovered bones dating back more than 20,000 years that seem to have tally marks. The oldest known such bones with markings that are thought to represent numbers are the Ishango bone and the Lebombo bone. The Ishango bone, dating back 20,000 to 35,000 years, was discovered in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It features notches arranged in columns, possibly indicating calendrical systems. The Lebombo bone, discovered in South Africa, is an even older tally stick with 29 notches, estimated to be around 44,000 years old. It is considered one of the oldest mathematical artefacts, and may have served as a tally stick or lunar calendar. Lebombo bone Ishango bone Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 56 III.

Number Names Obtained by Counting in Twos A group of indigenous people in Australia called the Gumulgal had the following words for their numbers. Can you see how their number names are formed? The number name for 3 is composed of number names of 2 and 1. The number name for 4 is composed of two occurrences of the number name for 2. Can you see how the names of the other numbers are formed? The numbers are counted in 2s, using which the number names are formed: 3 = 2 + 1, 4 = 2 + 2, 5 = 2 + 2 + 1, 6 = 2 + 2 + 2. Gumulgal called any number greater than 6 ras. There is a very interesting and puzzling historical phenomenon associated with this number system. Look at the following number systems of a group of indigenous people in South America, and the Bushmen of South Africa: Gumulgal (Australia) 1. urapon 2. ukasar 3. ukasar-urapon 4. ukasar-ukasar 5. ukasar-ukasar-urapon 6. ukasar-ukasar-ukasar Map not to scale India Gumulgal Bushmen Bakairi 1 - tokale 2 - ahage 3 - ahage tokale (or ahawao) 4 - ahage ahage tokale 5 - ahage ahage ahage 1 - xa 2 - t'oa 3 - 'quo 4 - t'oa-t'oa 5 - t'oa-t'oa-t'a 6 - t'oa-t'oa-t'oa 1 - urapon 2 - ukasar 3 - ukasar-urapon 4 - ukasar-ukasar 5 - ukasar-ukasar-urapon 6 - ukasar-ukasar-ukasar A Story of Numbers 57 Despite being so far apart geographically, and with no trace of contact between them, these three groups have developed equivalent number systems!

Historians have wondered how this happened. One theory is that these three groups of people may have had common ancestors, who used this number system. In course of time, their descendants migrated to these places. Even though the number system of Gumulgal had number names for numbers only till 6, we can see the emergence of an idea here. Counting in 2s is more efficient for representing numbers than, for example, a tally system. A general form which this idea has taken in different number systems is as follows: count in groups of a certain number (like 2 in the case of Gumulgal’s system), and use the word or symbol associated with this group size to represent bigger numbers. Some of the commonly used group sizes in different number systems have been 2, 5, 10 and 20. You can find the idea of counting by 5s in the Roman system (Table 1). One of the phenomena that could have led people to this idea might be the human limit for immediately knowing the size of a collection at a glance. Let us try out the following activity. Quickly count the number of objects in each of the following boxes: Up to what group size could you immediately see the number of objects without counting? Most humans find it difficult to count groups having 5 or more objects in a single glance. This limit of perception could have prompted people using tally marks to replace every group of, say, 5 marks, with a new symbol, as seen in the system shown in Table 1. This idea"}

Math Talk Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 58 What could be the difficulties with using a number system that counts only in groups of a single particular size? How would you represent a number like 1345 in a system that counts only by 5s? Even though counting in groups of a particular size and using it for number representation is more efficient than the tally system, this method can still become cumbersome for larger numbers. The next system shows a refinement of this idea. IV. The Roman Numerals We have already seen the Roman number system till 20 (Table 1). We have seen that it uses I for 1, V for 5, X for 10. To get the Roman numeral for any number till 39, it is first grouped into as many 10s as possible, the remaining is grouped into as many 5s as possible, and finally the remaining is grouped into 1s. Example: Let us take the number 27. 27 = 10 + 10 + 5 + 1 + 1 So, 27 in Roman numerals is XXVII. Instead of representing 50 as XXXXX, a new symbol is given to it: L. Following the way the number 4 is represented as 1 less than 5 — that is, as IV — 40 is represented as 10 less than 50 — that is, as XL."}

However, people using this system were not always consistent with this practice. Sometimes, 40 was also represented as XXXX. The Roman number system introduces newer symbols to represent certain bigger numbers. Let us call all these numbers that have a new basic symbol as landmark numbers. Here are some of the landmark numbers of the Roman system and their associated numerals.

In the Roman system, the grouping and rearranging has to be done carefully as it is not always by the same size that each landmark number has to be grouped to get the next one.

As has been seen, a process of multiplying two numbers involves the multiplication of landmark numbers. When the landmark numbers are powers of a number, then their product is another landmark number. This fact simplifies the process of multiplication. However, this is not the case with the Roman numerals, which is why multiplication using them is difficult. Thus, a number system whose landmark numbers are powers of a number, i.e., a number system with a base, is efficient not only in number representation but also in its utility in carrying out arithmetic operations. The idea of a number system with a base was a turning point in the history of the evolution of number systems. Our modern Hindu number system is built on this structure.

Numbers were represented in it as follows: the given number was first grouped into the landmark numbers (powers of 10), in exactly the same way we have been grouping them so far. For each power of 10, as many counters were placed on its line as the number of times it occurred Fig. 3.1: Abacus A Story of Numbers 69 in the grouping. The presence of a counter above a line contributed a value of 5. For example let us take the number 3426.

Different theories exist to explain this, ranging from the connection between 60 and the periods of some important events (like the length of their lunar month which had 30 days, or the time taken for the Sun to complete one revolution around the Earth when Earth is taken to be stationary), the ease of representing fractions (we will not go into this here), their earlier sequence of landmark numbers — 1, 10, 60, 600, 3600, 36000,… — getting reduced to only the powers of 60, and so on. The influence of the Mesopotamian sexagesimal system, also known as the Babylonian number system, can be seen even now in our units of time measurements — 1 hour = 60 minutes and 1 minute = 60 seconds. This system used the symbol for 1 and for 10. Let us now briefly pause on the study of their number system, and ideate on how one can build an efficient number system using the Mesopotamian features seen so far. Math Talk A Story of Numbers 71 Let us give our own symbols to their landmark numbers — Note that we have actually used Indian numerals in creating these symbols. We could have invented our own symbols but for the sake of easy recall and use, we have chosen to take help of the familiar numerals 1, 2, 3, ...

We can simply represent this number as which can be read as ten 60s and one 40, just as we have written in the equation. Example: Let us try another number — 7530. 7530 = (2) ×3600 + (5) × 60 + 30 So, its representation would be Note that when a number is grouped into powers of 60 for its representation, no power of 60 can occur 60 or more times. If this happens, then 60 of them can be grouped to form the next power of 60. For example, consider the expression — (1) × 3600 + (70) × 60 + 2 = (1) × 602 + (60 + 10) × 60 + 2 = (1) × 602 + 602 + (10) × 60 + 2 = (2) × 602 + (10) × 60 + 2 Therefore, any number can be represented using the numerals from 1 – 59, along with the numerals for landmark numbers.

Whenever there was no occurrence of a power of 60, a blank space was given in that position. It does not seem that the Mesopotamians arrived at this idea in the same way we did. Some scholars suggest that the similarity of symbols given to the landmark numbers 1 and 60 in their earlier number system, and an accidental usage of them, might have made them stumble upon this idea.

The Mesopotamian system however cannot be considered a fully developed place value system. It has certain defects that lead to confusion while reading a number. Look at the representation of 60. What will be the representation for 3,600? While writing the numerals, the spacing between symbols was not given the way we are giving it here. It was also difficult to maintain a consistent spacing for blanks across different manuscripts written by different people. These created ambiguities. For example, consider the representations of the following numbers — Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 74 Because of the ambiguity in finding which symbols correspond to which powers of 60, the same numeral can be read in different ways. Even in our representation which uses uniform spacing between symbols for different powers of 60, it is difficult to know the number of blanks between two sets of symbols, as in the representation of 36002. To address the issue arising out of blank spaces, the later Mesopotamians used a brilliant idea of assigning a ‘placeholder’ symbol to denote a blank space. This is like the 0 (zero) we use in our system. Thus, zero — the symbol that shows nothingness — is indispensable as a placeholder in a place value system in which numbers are written in an unambiguous manner. Even with the problem arising out of blank spaces solved, other ambiguities still remained in the system. For example, the placeholder symbol was primarily used in the middle of numbers and not at the end; so they would not use it to represent a number like (what we would write as)"}

The Mayan Number System In Central America, there flourished a civilisation known as the Mayan civilisation that made great intellectual and cultural progress between the 3rd and 10th centuries CE. Among their intellectual achievements stands their place value system designed independently of those in Asia. They also made use of a placeholder symbol, for the modern-day ‘0’, that looked like a seashell. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 76 Here we find a puzzling phenomenon. Why was their third landmark number 360 rather than 400? Some scholars feel that this might have something to do with their calendars. They used a dot for 1, and a bar for 5. These were used to denote numbers from 1 to 19. The symbols associated with different landmark numbers were written one below the other with the lowermost set of symbols corresponding to the number of 1s, the set above corresponding to the number of 20s, the set above to the number of 360s and so on. Represent the following numbers using the Mayan system: (i) 77 (ii) 100 (iii) 361 (iv) 721 Because the Mayan system is not an actual base-20 system, it lacks the advantages that a system with a base has for computations. Nevertheless, their place value notation and their use of a placeholder symbol for zero is considered an important advance in the history of number systems. A curious fact is that we can still find the use of base-20 in the number names of some European languages."}

The Chinese Number System The Chinese used two number systems — a written system for recording quantities, and a system making use of rods for performing computations. The numerals in the rod-based number system are called rod numerals. Here we discuss the rod numerals, which are more efficient in writing and computing with numbers than the written system of the Chinese. The rod numerals developed in China by at least by 3rd century AD and were used till the 17th century. It was a decimal system (base-10). The symbols for 1 to 9 were as follows: A Story of Numbers 77 CHINESE NUMBER SYSTEM Base-10 or Decimal \u0007Note: The zongs represent units, hundreds, tens of thousands, etc., and the hengs tens, thousands, hundreds of thousands, etc. How is this to be read? 2 (Heng) 6 (Zong) 3 (Heng) 4 (Zong) Landmark number positions 103 102 10 1 = (2) × 103 + (6) × 10² + (3) × 10 + (4) × 1 = 2634 A numeral Like the Mesopotamians, the rod numerals used a blank space to indicate the skipping of a place value. However, because of the slightly more uniform sizes of the symbols for one through nine, the blank spaces were easier to locate than in the Mesopotamian system.

The Hindu Number System Where does the Hindu/Indian number system figure in the evolution of ideas of number representation? What are its landmark numbers? And does it use a place value system?

The Hindu number system has had a symbol for 0 at least as early as 200 BCE. Because of the use of 0 as a digit, and the use of a single digit in each position, this system does not lead to any kind of ambiguity when A Story of Numbers 79 reading or writing numerals. It is for this reason that the Hindu number system is now used throughout the world. The use of 0 as a digit, and indeed as a number, was a breakthrough that truly changed the world of mathematics and science. In Indian mathematics, indeed, zero was not just used as a placeholder in the place value system, but was also given the status of a number in its own right, on par with other numbers.

The use of 0 as a number like any other number, on which one can perform the basic arithmetic operations, was codified by Brahmagupta in his work Brāhmasphuṭasiddhānta in 628 CE, as we learned in an earlier grade. By introducing 0 as a number, along with the negative numbers, Brahmagupta created what in modern terms is called a ring, i.e., a set of numbers that is closed under addition, subtraction, and multiplication (i.e., any two numbers in the set can be added, subtracted, or multiplied to get another number in that set). These new ideas laid the foundations for modern mathematics, and particularly for the areas of algebra and analysis. Hopefully, this gives you a sense of all the ideas that went into writing and computing with numbers in the way that we do today.

SUMMARY In this chapter, we will study some interesting types of four-sided figures and solve problems based on them. Such figures are commonly known as quadrilaterals. The word ‘quadrilateral’ is derived from Latin words — quadri meaning four, and latus referring to sides. Observe the following figures. Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii) are quadrilaterals, and the others are not. Why? The angles of a quadrilateral are the angles between its sides, as marked in Figs. (i), (ii), and (iii). We will start with the most familiar quadrilaterals — rectangles and squares. (i) (ii) (iii) (iv) (v) QUADRILATERALS 4 Quadrilaterals 83 4.1 Rectangles and Squares We know what rectangles are. Let us define them. Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which — (i) The angles are all right angles (90°), and (ii) The opposite sides are of equal length.

The strips can be modelled as line segments. They are the diagonals of the quadrilateral formed by their endpoints. For the quadrilateral to be a rectangle, we need to answer the following questions — 1. \u0007What is the length of the other diagonal? 2. \u0007What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals? 3. \u0007What should the angle be between the diagonals? Let us answer these questions using geometric reasoning (deduction). If that is challenging, try to construct/ measure some rectangles. To find the answers to these questions, let us suppose that we have placed the diagonals such that their endpoints form the vertices of a rectangle, as shown in Fig. 2.

You can verify this property by constructing/measuring some rectangles. Deduction 2 — What is the point of intersection of the two diagonals? This can also be found using congruence.

This shows that the diagonals of a rectangle always intersect at their midpoints. Therefore, to get a rectangle, the diagonals must be drawn so that they are equal and intersect at their midpoints.

The Process of Finding Properties As we have been seeing from lower grades, properties of geometric objects such as parallel lines, angles, and triangles can be deduced through geometric reasoning. We will continue to deduce properties of special types of quadrilaterals in this chapter. Once you have deduced a property of a quadrilateral, it is good to verify it with a real-world quadrilateral, either the quadrilateral constructed on paper or simply a surface having the shape of the quadrilateral. If you are not able to figure out the property using deduction, you could experiment by taking real-world quadrilaterals and observing the property through measurement. Note that these observations give useful insights about the property, but with them, we can only form a conjecture, that is, a statement about which we are highly confident, but not yet sure if it always holds true. For example, constructing a few rectangles and observing through measurement that their diagonals bisect each other does not necessarily mean that this will always be the case — can we be sure that the 1000th rectangle we construct will also have this property? The only way we can be sure of this property is by justifying or proving the statement, just as we did in Deduction 2.

Quadrilaterals 89 The Carpenter’s Problem shows that rectangles can also be defined as follows — Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral whose diagonals are equal and bisect each other. Observe how different this definition is from the earlier one. Yet, both capture the same class of quadrilaterals. Further, it turns out that the first definition can be simplified. In the earlier definition, we stated that a rectangle has (a) opposite sides of equal length, and (b) all angles equal to 90°. Would we be wrong if we just define a rectangle as a quadrilateral in which all the angles are 90°? If you think that this definition is incomplete, try constructing a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90° but the opposite sides are not equal. Are you able to construct such a quadrilateral? Let us prove why this is impossible. Deduction 4 — What is the shape of a quadrilateral with all the angles equal to 90°? Consider a quadrilateral ABCD with all angles measuring 90°. What can we say about the opposite sides of such a quadrilateral? Join BD. ∆BAD and ∆DCB seem congruent. Can we justify this claim? Two equalities can be directly seen in the triangles. What can we say about ∠1 and ∠2? Recall that we tackled a very similar problem in Deduction 2. We can use the same reasoning here. 1 A B D C 2 Common side Since ∠B = 90°, ∠3 + ∠1 = 90°.

Therefore, AD = CB, and DC = BA, since these are corresponding sides of congruent triangles. Is it wrong to write ∆BAD ≅ ∆CDB? Why? Thus, we have established that if all the angles of a quadrilateral are right angles, then the opposite sides have equal lengths. Therefore, the quadrilateral is a rectangle. Thus, a rectangle can simply be defined as follows — Rectangle: A rectangle is a quadrilateral in which the angles are all 90°. Let us list the properties of a rectangle. Property 1: All the angles of a rectangle are 90°. Property 2: The opposite sides of a rectangle are equal. Are the opposite sides of a rectangle parallel? They definitely seem so. This fact can be justified using one of the transversal properties. Notice that AB acts as a transversal to AD and BC, and that ∠A + ∠B = 90° + 90° = 180°. When the sum of the internal angles on the same side of the transversal is 180°, the lines are parallel.

Square: A square is a quadrilateral in which all the angles are equal to 90°, and all the sides are of equal length. Thus, every square is also a rectangle, but clearly every rectangle is not a square. I am an Indian and I am a Malayali. Wait, which one of them are you — an Indian or a Malayali?

If the wooden strips have to be placed such that the thread passing through their endpoints forms a square, what must be done? As in the previous case, let us try to construct a square, one of whose diagonals is of length 8 cm. While solving the Carpenter’s Problem for the case of a rectangle, we have seen that to get a quadrilateral with all angles 90° (and opposite sides of equal length), the diagonals have to be drawn such that — (i) they are of equal lengths, and (ii) they bisect each other.

Since these angles are corresponding parts of congruent triangles, they are equal. Further, these angles together form a straight angle. So ∠BOA + ∠BOC = 180°. Thus, these angles have to be 90° each. A B D C O D A C B O Common Side Quadrilaterals 93 This shows that the diagonals of a square bisect each other at right angles. This means that the diagonals have to be drawn such that they are of equal lengths and bisect each other at right angles. Since the endpoints of the diagonals uniquely determine the vertices of a quadrilateral, we will get a square when the diagonals are joined this way. Using this fact, construct a square with a diagonal of length 8 cm. Properties of a Square Since a square is a special type of rectangle, all the properties of a rectangle hold true for a square.

You might have observed through constructions that this may not be possible. But why not? This is due to a general property of quadrilaterals related to their angles. We have seen that the sum of the angles of a triangle is 180°.

We get two triangles ∆SEM and ∆SOM. In ∆SEM, we have ∠1 + ∠2 + ∠3 = 180°. And in ∆SOM, ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠6 = 180°. What do we get when we add all six angles? We will have ∠1+ ∠2 + ∠3 + ∠4 + ∠5 + ∠6 = 180° + 180° = 360°. Or, (∠1+ ∠4) + (∠3 + ∠6) +∠2 + ∠5 = 360°. Since (∠1 + ∠4), (∠3 + ∠6), ∠2 and ∠5 are the angles of this quadrilateral, we have the following result — The sum of all angles in any quadrilateral is 360°. This explains why it is impossible for a quadrilateral to have three right angles, with the fourth angle not right angle. 4.3 \u0007More Quadrilaterals with Parallel Opposite Sides Rectangles (and therefore squares) have parallel opposite sides.

Are there quadrilaterals that have parallel opposite sides that are not rectangles? Let us try constructing one. This can be easily done by drawing two pairs of parallel lines, ensuring that they do not meet at right angles. Construct such a figure by recalling how parallel lines can be constructed using a ruler and a set-square, or a compass and a ruler. Observe the quadrilateral ABCD. It has parallel opposite sides but is not a rectangle. Thus, a larger set of quadrilaterals exists in which the opposite sides are parallel. Such quadrilaterals are called parallelograms.

Hence, it is indeed a parallelogram. More specifically, a rectangle is a special kind of parallelogram with all its angles equal to 90°. Let us represent this relation using a Venn diagram. To understand the relations between the sides and the angles of a parallelogram, let us construct the following figure.

In the parallelogram ABCD, AB||CD, and AD is a transversal to them. ∠A + ∠D = 180° (sum of the internal angles on the same side of a transversal). Therefore, ∠D = 180 – ∠A = 180 – 30 = 150°. Similarly, AD||BC, and AB and CD are transversals to them. So, ∠A + ∠B = 180°. So, ∠C + ∠D = 180°. Using these equations, we get ∠B = 150° and ∠C = 30°. We see that in this parallelogram, the adjacent pairs of angles add up to 180° and opposite pairs of angles are equal. Thus, ∠A + ∠B = 180°, ∠A + ∠D = 180°, ∠C + ∠D = 180°, and ∠B + ∠C = 180°. And, ∠A = ∠C, and ∠B = ∠D. Since the adjacent angles are the interior angles on the same side of a transversal to a pair of parallel lines, they must add up to 180°. What about the opposite angles?

Similarly, since ∠A + ∠R = 180°, ∠A = 180 – ∠R = 180 – (180 – x) = 180 – 180 + x = x. Thus, ∠P = ∠A = x. Similarly, we can deduce that ∠ R = ∠E = 180 – x.

Let us explore this question through construction. Draw two equal sides AD and AB, that are not perpendicular to each other. Can we complete this quadrilateral so that all its sides are of the same length? Mark a point C whose distance from B and D is equal to AB (or AD). To do this, measure AB using a compass. Keeping this length as the radius, cut arcs from B and D. Now we have a quadrilateral with equal sidelengths and one of its angles 50°.

Thus, the angles of the rhombus ABCD are 50°, 130°, 50°, and 130°. So, in a rhombus opposite angles are equal to each other. Interestingly, there is one more way by which we could have figured out the other angles of the rhombus ABCD.

Where will the set of squares occur in this diagram? We know that a square is a rectangle. Since the opposite sides of a square are parallel, a square is also a parallelogram. Further, since all the sides of a square have the same length, a square is also a rhombus. Thus, the Venn diagram will be as follows.

Hint: \u0007Think of the rules for parity of the sum or difference of two numbers. Explanation 1: Let us consider any of the 8 expressions formed by four numbers a, b, c, and d. When one of its signs is switched, its value always increases or decreases by an even number! Let us see why. Consider one of the expressions: a + b – c – d. Replacing +b by – b, we get a – b – c – d. By how much has the number changed? It has changed by (a + b – c – d) – (a – b – c – d) = a + b – c – d – a + b + c + d (notice how the signs changed when we opened the second set of brackets) = 2b (this is an even number). If the difference between two numbers is even, can they have different parities? No! So either both are even or both are odd. Now, let us see what happens when a negative sign is switched to a positive sign. Replace any negative sign in the expression a + b – c – d with a positive sign and find the difference between the two numbers. What do you conclude from this observation?

In short, a ± b have the same parity. By the same argument, a ± b + c and a ± b – c have the same parity. Extending this further, we can say that all the expressions a ± b ± c ± d have the same parity. Math Talk Number Play 115 Explanation 3: This can also be explained using the positive and negative token model you studied in the chapter on Integers. Try to think how. The number of ways to choose 4 numbers a, b, c, d and combine them using ‘+’ and ‘–’ signs is infinite.

When you add an odd number to an even number we get a multiple of 6. We know that multiples of 6 are all even numbers. The sum of an odd number and an even number will be an odd number. Therefore, this statement is never true. We can also explain this algebraically. Suppose, (2n) + (2m + 1) = 6j, where 2n is an even number, 2m + 1 is an odd number, and 6j is a multiple of 6. Then 2n + 2m = 6j – 1 2 (n + m) = 6j – 1 which means 2(n + m), which is an even number, should be equal to 6j – 1, which is an odd number. This is never true. What Remains?

Let us revisit them. Divisibility by 10, 5, and 2: If the units digit of a number is ‘0’, then it is divisible by 10. Let us understand why this works through algebra. We can write the general form of a number in the Indian system using a set of letter-numbers. For example, a 5-digit number can be expressed as, edcba denoting e × 10000 + d × 1000 + c × 100 + b × 10 + a. The letter-numbers e, d, c, b, and a denote each digit of a 5-digit number. Any number can be written in general as … dcba, where the letter- numbers a, b, c and d represent the units, tens, hundreds and thousands digit, respectively, and so on. As a sum of place values, this number is — … +1000d + 100c + 10b + a. (For example, in the number 4075, d = 4, c = 0, b = 7, and a = 5.) We know that each place value, with the exception of the units place, is a multiple of 10. So, 10b, 100c, … all will be multiples of 10. Hence, the number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0. Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2,"}

Hence, the number will be divisible by 10 if and only if the units digit a is 0. Similarly, explain using algebra why the divisibility shortcuts for 5, 2, 4, and 8 work. Let us now examine shortcuts to check divisibility by some other numbers and explain why they work! A Shortcut for Divisibility by 9 Can you say, without actually calculating, which of these numbers are divisible by 9: 999, 909, 900, 90, 990? All of them. Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 124 Can we say that any number made up of only the digits ‘0’ and ‘9’, in any order, will always be divisible by 9? Yes, if each digit is either 0 or 9, then each term in its expanded form will be 9 × or 0 × (the ‘ ’ denotes a place value). This means each term will be a multiple of 9, for example, 99009 = 9 × 10000 + 9 × 1000 + 0 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1. But this shortcut alone cannot identify all the multiples of 9. Unlike the numbers 2, 5, and 10, we cannot identify the multiples of 9 by just looking at the unit’s digit. 99 and 109 are two numbers with 9 as the units digit; but 99 is divisible by 9, while 109 is not. Is 10 divisible by 9? If not, what is the remainder? Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9. You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same as the number of tens. Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100"}
{"id": "Ncert_class8_m+s_37000", "source": "Ncert_class8_m+s", "text": "9? If not, what is the remainder? Check the divisibility of other multiples of 10 (10, 20, 30, ...) by 9. You will notice that for any multiple of 10, the remainder is the same as the number of tens. Similarly, look at the remainder when the multiples of 100 (100, 200, 300, … ) are divided by 9. What do you notice? The remainder is the same as the number of hundreds for any multiple of 100. Using this observation, find the remainder when 427 is divided by 9. We see that 427 has 4 hundreds; thus, its corresponding remainder (upon division by 9) would be 4. 427 has 2 tens, and its corresponding remainder would be 2. We have 7 units also remaining. Adding all the remainders, we get 4 + 2 + 7 = 13. We can make one more group of 9 with 13, leaving a remainder of 4. Therefore, 427 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 4. 99 99 1 1 9 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 400 20 7 99 1 9 1 9 1 99 1 99 1 99 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 4 9 (Remainder) Number Play 125 Will this work with bigger numbers? You can see that this is true for any place value: 1 = 0 + 1 10 = 9 + 1 100 = 99 + 1 1000 = 999 + 1 10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when the corresponding place value is divided by 9. For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can just add all the digits — 7"}
{"id": "Ncert_class8_m+s_37250", "source": "Ncert_class8_m+s", "text": "1 1000 = 999 + 1 10000 = 9999 + 1, and so on. Each digit thus denotes the remainder when the corresponding place value is divided by 9. For example, to find the remainder of 7309 when divided by 9, we can just add all the digits — 7 + 3 + 0 + 9 — to get 19. This can be seen as follows: 7 × 1000 + 3 × 100 + 0 × 10 + 9 × 1 = 7 × (999 + 1) + 3 × (99 + 1) + 0 × (9 + 1) + 9 × (0+1) = (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 × 1 + 3 × 1 + 0 × 1 + 9 × 1) = (7 × 999 + 3 × 99 + 0 × 9 + 9 × 0) + (7 + 3 + 0 + 9). This means that the number 7309 is 19 more than some multiple of 9. The digits 1 and 9 can further be added to get 1 + 9 = 10. Now, we can say that 7309 is 10 more than a multiple of 9. And repeating this step for the number 10, we get the remainder to be 1 + 0 = 1, meaning 7309 is 1 more than a multiple of 9. Therefore, 7309 ÷ 9 gives a remainder of 1. A number is divisible by 9 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 9. Also, we can add the digits of a number repeatedly till a single digit is obtained.

However, there are other multiples of 3 that are not multiples of 9 for example — 15, 33, and 87. The shortcut to find the divisibility by 3 is similar to the method for 9. A number is divisible by 3 if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3. Explore the remainders when powers of 10 are divided by 3. Explain why this method works. A Shortcut for Divisibility by 11 Interestingly, the shortcut for 11 is also based on checking the remainders with place value. Let us see how.

Digital Roots Take a number. Add its digits repeatedly till you get a single-digit number. This single-digit number is called the digital root of the number. For example, the digital root of the number 489710 will be 2 (4 + 8 + 9 + 7 + 1 + 0 = 29, 2 + 9 = 11, 1 + 1 = 2). What property do you think this digital root will have?

SUMMARY Multiples of 8 135 Navakankari Navakankari, also known as Sālu Mane Āṭa, Chār-Pār, or Navkakri, is a traditional Indian board game that is the same as ‛Nine Men’s Morris’ or ‛Mills in the West’. It is a strategy game for two players where the goal is to form lines of three pawns to eliminate the opponent’s pawns or block their movement. Gameplay 1. Each player starts with 9 pawns. The players take turns in placing their pawns on the marked intersections. An intersection can have at most one pawn. 2. Once all the pawns are placed, the players take turns to move one of their pawns to adjacent empty intersections to form lines of three. The line can be horizontal or vertical. 3. Once a player makes a line with their pawns they can remove any one of the opponent’s pawns as long as it is not a part of one of their lines. A player wins if the opponent has less than 3 pawns or is unable to make a move. 6 WE DISTRIBUTE, YET THINGS MULTIPLY We have seen how algebra makes use of letter symbols to write general statements about patterns and relations in a compact manner.

In this chapter, we explore different types of multiplication patterns and show how they can be described in the language of algebra by making use of distributivity. 6.1 Some Properties of Multiplication Increments in Products Consider the multiplication of two numbers, say, 23 × 27. 1. \u0007By how much does the product increase if the first number (23) is increased by 1? 2. \u0007What if the second number (27) is increased by 1? 3. \u0007How about when both numbers are increased by 1? Do you see a pattern that could help generalise our observations to the product of any two numbers? Let us first consider a simpler problem — find the increase in the product when 27 is increased by 1. From the definition of multiplication (and the commutative property), it is clear that the product increases by 23. This can be seen from the distributive property of multiplication as well. If a, b and c are three numbers, then — We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply 137 This is called the distributive property of multiplication over addition. Using the identity a (b + c) = ab + ac with a = 23, b = 27, and c = 1, we have Remember that here, a (b + c) and 23 (27 + 1) mean a × (b + c), and 23 × (27 + 1), respectively.

We usually skip writing the ‘×’ symbol before or after brackets, just as in the case of expressions like 5a, xy, etc. We can also similarly expand (a + b) c using the distributive property as follows — (a + b) c = c (a + b) (commutativity of multiplication) = ca + cb (distributivity) = ac + bc (commutativity of multiplication) We can use the distributive property to find, in general, how much a product increases if one or both the numbers in the product are increased by 1. Suppose the initial two numbers are a and b. If one of the numbers, say b, is increased by 1, then we have — Now let us see what happens if both numbers in a product are increased by 1.

Let us consider (a + 1) as a single term. Then, by the distributive property, we have Thus, the product ab increases by a + b + 1 when each of a and b are increased by 1. What would we get if we had expanded (a + 1) (b + 1) by first taking (b + 1) as a single term? Try it? What happens when one of the numbers in a product is increased by 1 and the other is decreased by 1? Will there be any change in the product? Let us again take the product ab of two numbers a and b. If a is increased by 1 and b is decreased by 1, then their product will be (a + 1) (b – 1). Expanding this, we get Will the product always increase? Find 3 examples where the product decreases. What happens when a and b are negative integers? Check by substituting different values for a and b in each of the above cases. For example, a = –5, b = 8; a = –4, b = –5; etc. We have seen that integers also satisfy the distributive property, that is, if x, y and z are any three integers, then x (y + z) = xy"}

Thus, the expressions we have for increase of products hold when the letter-numbers take on negative integer values as well. Recall that two algebraic expressions are equal if they take on the same values when their letter-numbers are replaced by numbers. These (a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1 = ab + (b + a + 1) Increase (a + 1) (b + 1) = (a + 1) b + (a + 1) 1 Again applying the distributive property, we obtain (23 + 1) (27 + 1) = (23 + 1) 27 + (23 + 1) 1 = 23 × 27 + (27 + 23 + 1) Increase If a = 23, and, b = 27, we get (a + 1) (b – 1) = (a + 1) b – (a + 1) 1 = ab + b – (a + 1) = ab + b – a – 1 Increase (23 + 1) (27 – 1) = (23 + 1) 27 – (23 + 1) 1 = 23 × 27 + 27 – (23 + 1) = 23 × 27 + 27 – 23 – 1 Increase If a = 23, and b = 27, we get We Distribute, Yet Things Multiply 139 numbers could be any integers.

By how much will the product of two numbers change if one of the numbers is increased by m and the other by n? If a and b are the initial numbers being multiplied, they become a + m and b + n.

Can you see how this identity can be used when one or both numbers are decreased? For example, let us reconsider the case when one number is increased by 1 and the other decreased by 1. Let us write the product (a + 1) (b – 1) as (a + 1) (b + (–1). Taking m = 1 and n = –1 in Identity 1, we have ab + (1) × b + a × (–1) + (1) × (–1) = ab + b – a – 1, which is the same expression that we obtain earlier. Use Identity 1 to find how the product changes when (i) one number is decreased by 2 and the other increased by 3; (ii) both numbers are decreased, one by 3 and the other by 4. Verify the answers by finding the products without converting the subtractions to additions. Generalising this, we can find the product (a + u) (b – v) as follows.

Check that this is the same as taking m = u and n = –v in Identity 1. As in Identity 1, the product (a + u) (b – v) is the sum of the product of each term of a + u (a and u) with each term of b – v (b and (–v)). Notice that the signs of the terms in the products can be determined using the usual rules of integer multiplication. Expand (i) (a – u) (b + v), (ii) (a – u) (b – v). We get (a – u) (b + v) = ab – ub + av – uv, and (a – u) (b – v) = ab – ub – av + uv. The distributive property is not restricted to two terms within a bracket.

Can any two terms be added to get a single term? For example, can 3 2 a2 and 3 10 a be added to get a single term? We see that no two terms have exactly the same letter-numbers, which would have allowed them to be simplified into a single term. So, a further simplification of the expression is not possible. Recall that we call terms having the same letter-numbers like terms. Example 2: Expand (a + b) (a + b). We have (a + b) (a + b) = (a+b) a + (a + b)b = a × a + b × a + ab + b × b = a2 + ba + ab + b2 Since ba = ab, we have two terms having the same letter-numbers ab (or, that are like terms), and so can be added — ba + ab = ab + ab = 2ab So we get (a + b) (a + b) = a2 + 2ab + b2.

A Pinch of History The distributive property of multiplication over addition was implicit in the calculations of mathematicians in many ancient civilisations, particularly in ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, Greece, China, and India. For example, the mathematicians Euclid (in geometric form) and Āryabhaṭa (in algebraic form) used the distributive law in an implicit manner extensively in their mathematical and scientific works.

The first explicit statement of the distributive property was given by Brahmagupta in his work Brahmasphuṭasiddhānta (Verse 12.55), who referred to the use of the property for multiplication as khaṇḍa-guṇanam (multiplication by parts). His verse states, “The multiplier is broken up into two or more parts whose sum is equal to it; the multiplicand is then multiplied by each of these and the results added”. That is, if there are two parts, then using letter symbols this is equivalent to the identity (a + b) c = ac + bc.

But B is also a rectangle! Why does it look different from the other rectangular images? Can we observe any pattern to answer this question? Perhaps by measuring the rectangles?

But the width of B is not half the width of A. Since the width and height have not changed by the same factor, the images look different. Can you check by what factors the width and height of image D change as compared to image A? Are the factors the same? Images A, C, and D look similar because their widths and heights have changed by the same factor. We say that the changes to their widths and heights are proportional. Math Talk Proportional Reasoning-1 161 7.2 Ratios We use the notion of a ratio to represent such proportional relationships in mathematics. We can say that the ratio of width to height of image A is 60 : 40. The numbers 60 and 40 are called the terms of the ratio.\u0007 The ratio of width to height of image C is 30 : 20, and that of image D is 90 : 60. In a ratio of the form a : b, we can say that for every ‘a’ units of the first quantity, there are ‘b’ units of the second quantity. So, in image A, we can say that for every 60 mm of width, there are 40 mm of height. We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same factor. Let us see how.

We can say that the ratios of width to height of images A, C, and D are proportional because the terms of these ratios change by the same factor. Let us see how. Image A — 60 : 40 Multiplying both the terms by 1 2, we get 60 × 1 2 : 40 × 1 2 which is 30 : 20, the ratio of width to height in image C. By what factor should we multiply the ratio 60 : 40 (image A) to get 90 : 60 (image D)? A more systematic way to compare whether the ratios are proportional is to reduce them to their simplest form and see if these simplest forms are the same. 7.3 Ratios in their Simplest Form We can reduce ratios to their simplest form by dividing the terms by their HCF. In image A, the terms are 60 and 40. What is the HCF of 60 and 40? It is 20. Dividing the terms by 20, we get the ratio of image A to be 3 : 2 in its simplest form. The ratio of image D is 90 : 60. Dividing both terms by 30 (HCF of 90 and 60), we get the simplest form to be 3 : 2. So the ratios of images A and D are proportional as well. What is the simplest form of the ratios of images B and E? The ratio of image B is 40 : 20; in its simplest form, it is 2 : 1. The ratio of image E is 60 : 60; in its simplest form, it is 1 : 1.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 162 These ratios are not the same as 3 : 2. So, we can say that the ratios of width to height of images B and E are not proportional to the ratios of images A, C, and D. When two ratios are the same in their simplest forms, we say that the ratios are in proportion, or that the ratios are proportional. We use the ‘::’ symbol to indicate that they are proportional. So a : b :: c : d indicates that the ratios a : b and c : d are proportional. Thus, 60 : 40 :: 30 : 20 and 60 : 40 :: 90 : 60. 7.4 Problem Solving with Proportional Reasoning Example 1: Are the ratios 3 : 4 and 72 : 96 proportional? 3 : 4 is already in its simplest form. To find the simplest form of 72 : 96, we need to divide both terms by their HCF. What is the HCF of 72 and 96? The HCF of 72 and 96 is 24. Dividing both terms by 24, we get 3 : 4. Since both ratios in their simplest form are the same, they are proportional. Example 2: Kesang wanted to make lemonade for a celebration. She made 6 glasses of lemonade in a vessel and added 10 spoons of sugar to the drink. Her father expected more people to join the celebration. So he asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade.

So he asked her to make 18 more glasses of lemonade. To make the lemonade with the same sweetness, how many spoons of sugar should she add? To maintain the same sweetness, the ratio of the number of glasses of lemonade to the number of spoons of sugar should be proportional. For 6 glasses of lemonade, she added 10 spoons of sugar. The ratio of glasses of lemonade to spoons of sugar is 6 : 10. If she needs to make 18 more glasses of lemonade, how many spoons of sugar should she use? We can model this problem as — 6 : 10 :: 18 : ? We know that each term in the ratio must change by the same factor, for the ratios to be proportional. How can we find the factor of change in the ratio? The first term has increased from 6 to 18. To find the factor of change, we can divide 18 by 6 to get 3. Proportional Reasoning-1 163 The second term should also change by the same factor. When 10 increases by a factor of 3, it becomes 30. Thus, 6 : 10 :: 18 : 30. So, she should use 30 spoons of sugar to make 18 glasses of lemonade with the same sweetness as earlier. Example 3: Nitin and Hari were constructing a compound wall around their house.

Nitin used 3 bags of cement but Hari used only 2 bags of cement. Nitin was worried that the wall Hari built would not be as strong as the wall he built because she used less cement. Is Nitin correct in his thinking? In Nitin and Hari’s case, we should compare the ratio of the length of the wall to the bags of cement used by each of them and see whether they are proportional. The ratio in Nitin’s case is 60 : 3, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form). The ratio in Hari’s case is 40 : 2, i.e., 20 : 1 (in its simplest form). Since both ratios are proportional, the walls are equally strong. Nitin should not worry! Example 4: In my school, there are 5 teachers and 170 students.

Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 164 Example 6: When Neelima was 3 years old, her mother’s age was 10 times her age. What is the ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age? What would be the ratio of their ages when Neelima is 12 years old? Would it remain the same? The ratio of Neelima’s age to her mother’s age when Neelima is 3 years old is 3 : 30 (her mother’s age is 10 times Neelima’s age). In the simplest form, it is 1 : 10. When Neelima is 12 years old (i.e., 9 years later), the ratio of their ages will be 12 : 39 (9 years later, her mother would be 39 years old). In the simplest form, it is 4 : 13. When we add (or subtract) the same number from the terms of a ratio, the ratio changes and is not necessarily proportional to the original ratio.

It is 2 times the second term of the ratio 14 : 21. So, the first term should also be 2 times 14 (the first term). Hence the proportional ratio is 28 : 42. For the second ratio, the first term is 6. What factor should we multiply 14 by to get 6? Can it be an integer? Or should it be a fraction? We can model this as 14y = 6. So, y = 6 14 = 3 7. So, we need to multiply 21 (the second term of 14 : 21) also by the same factor 3 7. 21 × 3 7 is 9. So, the ratio is 6 : 9. In the third ratio, the first term is 2. We can see that when we divide 14 (the first term of 14 : 21) by 7 (HCF of 14 and 21) we get 2. If we divide 21 also by 7, we get 3. So, the ratio is 2 : 3. Filter Coffee!

So, c = f a ...(1) d = f b ...(2) From (1) and (2), we can say that, f = c a and f = d b . Therefore, c a = d b.

This is known as cross multiplication of terms. Since ad = bc, we can show that d = bc a . Two ratios are proportional if their terms are equal when cross multiplied. The fourth unknown quantity can be found through such cross multiplication. In ancient India, Āryabhaṭa (199 CE) and others called such problems of proportionality Rule of Three problems. There were 3 numbers given — the pramāṇa (measure — ‘a’ in our case), the phala (fruit — ‘b’ in our case), and the ichchhā (requisition — ‘c’ in our case). To find the ichchhāphala (yield — ‘d’ in our case), Āryabhaṭa says, “Multiply the phala by the ichchhā and divide the resulting product by the pramāṇa.” In other words, Āryabhaṭa says, “pramāṇa : phala :: ichchhā : ichchhāphala,” therefore, pramāṇa × ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā. Proportional Reasoning-1 169 Thus, ichchhāphala = phala × ichchhā pramāṇa . Using the cross multiplication method proposed by Āryabhaṭa, ancient Indians solved complex problems that involved proportionality. Example 9: A car travels 90 km in 150 minutes.

This would not be appropriate, because we considered the weight in grams in the case of Himachal. So, the weight to price ratio is 1000 : 800 in Meghalaya after we convert the weight to grams. To check if the ratios are proportional, we need to see if both ratios are the same in their simplest forms. The Himachal tea ratio in its simplest form is 1 : 1. The Meghalaya tea ratio in its simplest form is 5 : 4. So, the ratios are not proportional. Which tea is more expensive? Why? To answer the question as to which tea is more expensive, we should compare the price of tea for the same weight in both places. What is the price of 1 kg of tea from Meghalaya? It is ₹800. In Himachal, if 200 g of tea costs rupees 200, what is the cost of 1 kg of tea? Let us say that the price of 1 kg of tea is x rupees. 200 g is 1 5 of 1 kg. So, 1 5 × x = 200. Multiplying both sides by 5, we get 1 5 × x × 5 = 200 × 5 1 5 × x × 5 = 1000 x = 1000. So, the cost of 1 kg of tea is ₹800 in Meghalaya and ₹1,000 in Himachal Pradesh. Therefore, the tea from Himachal Pradesh is more expensive. Activity 1: Take your favourite dish. Find out all the ingredients and their respective quantities needed to make the dish for your family.

The Earth travels approximately 940 million kilometres around the Sun in a year. How many kilometres will it travel in a week? 2. A mason is building a house in the shape shown in the diagram. He needs to construct both the outer walls and the inner wall that Note to the Teacher: Encourage a discussion on the more expensive tea, how they came to their conclusions and what the reasons for that tea being more expensive could be. Proportional Reasoning-1 171 separates two rooms. To build a wall of 10-feet, he requires approximately 1450 bricks. How many bricks would he need to build the house? Assume all walls are of the same height and thickness. Puneeth’s father went from Lucknow to Kanpur in 2 hours by riding his motorcycle at a speed of 50 km/h. If he drives at 75 km/h, how long will it take him to reach Kanpur? Can we form this problem as a proportion — 50 : 2 :: 75 : __ Would it take Puneeth’s father more time or less time to reach Kanpur?

The ratio of the volume of a sachet to a small bottle is 6 : 180. The ratio of their prices is 2 : 154. Are these ratios proportional? Why do you think that the ratio of the prices is not proportional to the ratio of the volumes? Discuss the pros and cons of different size bottles for the company and for customers. For reducing ecological footprint, what would you recommend to the company and to the customer? Does the same occur for other products? Make similar tables for other products in the market, capturing different prices for different measures of the same product, e.g., rice or atta (flour). Observe the products for which the prices are proportional to the different measures. Discuss in class the proportionality of prices to measures of the same product. 7.5 Sharing, but Not Equally!

Now, share them between the two of you in different ways. \u0007If you divide them equally, what is the ratio of the number of counters with each of you? Each of you will get 6 counters. So, the ratio is 6 : 6, or 1 : 1 in its simplest form. Now let us not share equally. If your partner gets 5 counters, how many objects will you get? What is the ratio of the counters? Math Talk Note to the Teacher: Give a project to students. Start by dividing the class into groups. Each group should go to one shop and collect prices for different measures of the same product. For example, they should note down the prices of 500 g of rice, 1 kg of rice, and 10 kg of rice. They should make tables with measure sizes and prices, and present them to the rest of the class. They should discuss if the prices are proportional or not, and why. Proportional Reasoning-1 173 The ratio of the counters of your partner to yours is 5 : 7. Now, if you want to share the counters between the two of you in the ratio of 3 : 1, how many counters would each of you get? Share the counters in different ways and see which combination is in the ratio 3 : 1. One way to share the counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 is as follows — 1. Your partner takes 3 counters and you take 1 counter. There are now 8 counters left. 2. Your partner takes 3 more counters and you take 1 more counter. There are now 4"}

There are no more counters left. So, your partner gets 9 counters in total and you get 3 counters. When we divide 12 counters in the ratio of 3 : 1 between two people, one gets 9 counters and the other gets 3 counters. Now, if you want to share 42 counters between the two of you in the ratio of 4 : 3, how will you do it? Using the same procedure would take a long time! There is a simpler way to share the whole with parts in a specified ratio. You need to divide 42 into groups such that your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups. What is the size of each group? If your partner gets 4 groups and you get 3 groups, the total number of groups is 7. So, the size of each group is 42 ÷ 7 = 6. Multiplying the number of groups by the size of each group, your partner gets 24 counters and you get 18 counters, when you share 42 counters in the ratio of 4 : 3. 12 3 1 : : 9 3 Sharing 12 in the ratio 3 : 1 The ‛whole’ is 12 The ‛whole’ is 4 (= 3 + 1) and 12 is 3 times 4 The ‛parts’ are 3 times the ratio 3 : 1 × 3 × 3 Ganita Prakash | Grade 8 174"}

We need to split x into groups such that it can be divided into two parts where the first part has m groups and the second part has n groups. 2. But what is the size of each group? This can be found out by dividing x by the number of groups. The number of groups are m + n. So, the size of each group is x m + n . 3. So, the first part has m × x m + n objects and the second part has n × x m + n objects. Thus, if we want to divide a quantity x in the ratio of m: n, then the parts will be m × x m + n and n × x m + n. We see that m × x m + n : n × x m + n :: m : n. Example 11: Prashanti and Bhuvan started a food cart business near their school. Prashanti invested ₹75,000 and Bhuvan invested ₹25,000. At the end of the first month, they gained a profit of ₹4,000. They decided that they would share the profit in the same ratio as that of their investment. What is each person’s share of the profit? The ratio of their investment is 75000 : 25000. Reducing this ratio to its simplest form, we get 3 : 1."}

The ratio is 3 : 1 and the total weight is 40 kg. So, the weight of sand is 3 (3 + 1) × 40 = 30 kg. The weight of cement is 1 (3 + 1) × 40 = 10 kg. The weight of sand is the same in the new mixture. It remains 30. But the new ratio of sand to cement is 5 : 2. So the question is, 5 : 2 :: 30 : ? If the ratio is 5 : 2, then the second term is 2 5 times the first term.

ISBN 978-93-5729-772-1 0877 – Curiosity Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The National Education Policy (NEP) 2020 envisages a system of education in the country that is rooted in an Indian ethos and its civilisational accomplishments in all fields of knowledge and human endeavour. At the same time, it aims to prepare students to engage constructively with the opportunities and challenges of the twenty-first century. The basis for this aspirational vision has been well laid out by the National Curriculum Framework for School Education (NCF-SE) 2023 across curricular areas at all stages. By nurturing students’ inherent abilities across all five planes of human existence (pañchakośhas), the Foundational and Preparatory Stages set the Stage for further learning at the Middle Stage. Spanning Grades 6 to 8, the Middle Stage serves as a critical three-year bridge between the Preparatory and Secondary Stages. The NCF-SE 2023, at the Middle Stage, aims to equip students with the skills that are needed to grow, as they advance in their lives. It strives to enhance their analytical, descriptive, and narrative capabilities, and to prepare them for the challenges and opportunities that await them. A diverse curriculum, covering nine subjects ranging from three languages—including at least two languages native to India—to Science, Mathematics, Social Sciences, Art Education, Physical Education and Well-being, and Vocational Education promotes their holistic development.

Such a transformative learning culture requires certain essential conditions. One of them is to have appropriate textbooks in different curricular areas, as these textbooks are intended to play a central role in mediating between content and pedagogy—a role that helps strike a judicious balance between direct instruction and opportunities for exploration and inquiry. Among other conditions, classroom arrangement and teacher preparation are crucial to establish conceptual connections both within and across curricular areas. The National Council of Educational Research and Training, on its part, is committed to providing students with such high-quality textbooks. Various Curricular Area Groups, which have been constituted for this purpose, comprising notable subject-experts, pedagogues, and practising teachers as their members, have made all possible efforts to develop such textbooks. The Curiosity, textbook of science for Grade 8 is designed to make learning fun, engaging, and meaningful. Aligned with the NEP 2020 and the NCF-SE 2023, the textbook promotes experiential and inquiry-based learning. It encourages students to ask questions, think critically, Foreword iv and understand scientific concepts through real-world contexts. Integrating physics, chemistry, biology, and earth science, the textbook also highlights environmental awareness, ethical values, and insights from India’s rich tradition of knowledge. Featuring numerous hands-on activities and relatable examples, the book aims to simplify complex topics and foster deeper understanding. Collaborative learning is encouraged through group work and peer discussions, helping learners develop creativity, logical thinking, and decision-making skills.

Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 1 Exploring the Investigative World of Science 1 Dear Young Scientists, Welcome back! On the first page of each chapter, you will find a set of questions. These are not meant for any exam— they are unique invitations to spark your curiosity to explore the world of science! Why is one side of a puri thinner than the other? Are there more grains of sand on all the beaches and deserts of the world, or more stars in our galaxy? Right from Grade 6, we’ve observed the incredible diversity of plants and animals around us. From the different shapes of leaves to the many kinds of insects — why has nature created such a vast variety? Is there such a question that makes you curious about the world? Write it here! _________________________________ Probe and ponder 2 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Our journey with Curiosity, into the world of science continues in Grade 8. We hope you bring along the spirit of adventure and exploration that has guided us so far.

In Grade 6, we discovered how science begins with wonder, with simple “Why?” and “How?” questions about the world around us. In Grade 7, we learnt that science is always evolving — that each answer opens new questions, and how our ideas can slowly change as we explore deeper. Now, in Grade 8, we take the next step: entering the Investigative World of Science, where wonder and evolution come together to form the heart of how science works. We don’t want you to just learn new facts, we want you to learn how to find new facts. Investigation in science means more than just looking at something and asking only simple questions. Now you can ask more focused questions, and design ways to perhaps do simple experiments to answer those questions, and then use your observations to improve your understanding. Step by step, we will learn how to use questions as starting points to try to observe carefully, experiment thoughtfully, and explain clearly what we see. In doing so, each of you won’t just be learners but also investigators, young scientists, exploring real-world puzzles. These may range from everyday life — like why does dough rise? — to the bigger mysteries of Earth and beyond like is the world getting warmer? As you turn each page of this book, we hope you notice the interesting design of our page numbers once again.

On the right-hand pages, in the top corner, you’ll find a kite soaring in the sky, reminding us that curiosity must take flight if we are to explore the unknown. Together, these two symbols — the root and the kite — invite you to stay grounded in real observations, while allowing your ideas to soar towards new horizons. Remember, investigation in science works best only when we balance the solid ground of careful observation with the freedom of creative thinking. You will also notice some patterns in the lines at the bottom of the page. There are some hidden scientific thoughts in these as well. But don’t worry, they are mainly to make the page a little less boring. Let us now take a brief look at the various stops on our journey this year, and see where our curiosity, supported by strong roots and lifted by soaring ideas, might take us! Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 3 This year, our investigative adventure will take us on a journey from the tiny microbes we can’t see to planet-wide challenges we can’t ignore. We will start by examining something as small as a single drop of water, and uncover a hidden world of tiny organisms, unseen but deeply linked to us. Some of these are invisible helpers, that help us digest our food or produce medicines, while others can be harmful, causing infections. But what does our body need to stay healthy? How do we fight these infections? We’ll find out how nutritious food, exercise, medicines, and vaccines help us stay healthy and fight infections. But"}

But what does our body need to stay healthy? How do we fight these infections? We’ll find out how nutritious food, exercise, medicines, and vaccines help us stay healthy and fight infections. But that’s just the beginning. In today’s world, science does play a major role in improving our lives. For example, we use electric current in many ways to help make our lives easier. We depend on the heating effect of electric current to keep us warm, while the magnetic effect helps motors run and machines function. These phenomena depend on fundamental forces. So after watching electricity do work, we move on to study these forces themselves, starting with those that make objects speed up, slow down, or change direction. Understanding forces helps explain why a ball thrown up in the air falls back to the ground, or why a car stops when the brakes are applied. This also leads us to the idea of pressure — how the force is distributed over an object. The same concepts of force and pressure also decide how air moves. A small difference in pressure can result in a gentle breeze while a stronger pressure difference can lead to strong winds, and sometimes even cyclones. 4 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 So, these forces are connected to powerful weather events—like storms and cyclones—that affect our daily lives, agriculture, and even our safety. To truly understand how air can exert pressure or why water boils at a certain temperature we need to zoom into these materials and see what kind of particles they are made up of, and how they move around.

Everything around us is made of tiny particles. In materials that are solid these particles cannot move much, while in gases they can move around freely. Classifying things around us is an important feature of science. We can also classify materials around us into elements (pure substances), compounds (two or more elements bonded together), and mixtures (combinations that can be separated physically). Once we know how particles combine or mix, we can then understand solutions — for example, how sugar dissolves in tea to make it sweet. From the world of particles and mixtures, we then move into the world of light. We’ll study how light rays reflect off flat and curved mirrors, and bends when passing through lenses and helps us understand the working of many objects around us. The bending of light explains what happens when we see an image in a shiny metal spoon or how corrective glasses help many of us see clearly. It’s not just a polished mirror that reflects light, rough surfaces reflect light as well, and so does the Moon. Depending on the relative positions of the Earth, Moon and Sun, a slightly different part of the Moon is illuminated each night, giving rise to the beautiful phases of the Moon that we see in the sky. Watching the periodic cycles of the Moon’s phases allowed humans to come up with the first calendars.

By combining careful observations of sunrises, sunsets, and lunar cycles, various calendars came into being. Isn’t it fascinating that the calendars which determine our routines on Earth are linked to the motions of objects far beyond our planet? Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 5 But it’s not just calendars or the movements of the Sun and Moon that are linked. Right here on Earth, there are marvellous and complex patterns of relationships between living organisms and their environments. Every living being — from tiniest insect to the largest whale, from blades of grasses to tall trees — depends on and responds to the air, water, sunlight, and other organisms around them forming the ecosystems that support life on our planet. In the final chapter of this book, we can put it all together and try to understand what makes Earth ‘just right’ for life and to recognise the urgent challenges that our planet now faces. Most importantly, the Earth lies at the perfect distance from the Sun, where water remains liquid, and it has an atmosphere that provides the oxygen we breathe while shielding us from harmful ultraviolet rays. But human activities on the planet can cause small changes in the temperature of the Earth, disrupting climate patterns, with dangerous consequences.

We are the ones influencing Earth’s climate. But we are also the ones who can — and must — use science to understand these changes and guide our actions. The same scientific principles that we have guided our journey through the middle stages — observing, measuring, experimenting — will be key in helping us protect the delicate balance on which life depends. The challenges ahead won’t always be easy. We hope some of you will try to solve these difficult problems with Curiosity as your guide. 6 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 To help you think like a scientist, let us go back to a question we asked on the first page: Why is one side of a puri thinner than the other? Firstly, remember that science is everywhere! You don’t need a fancy laboratory to do simple experiments. Even your kitchen at home is a wonderful place to observe and ask questions. All you need is to start with curiosity, careful observation, and asking what happens if…? Have you noticed how a puri or a batura puffs up when placed in hot oil? Or how a phulka swells when put directly on the flame. Why does it puff up like a balloon? And why is one side thinner than the other? These are questions a scientist might ask — and"}

Why does it puff up like a balloon? And why is one side thinner than the other? These are questions a scientist might ask — and you can too! Let’s see how we can investigate this simple everyday phenomenon like a scientist would. First, we will try to ask a scientific question. What are the different things that may change the way a puri puffs up when fried? To answer this, we may want to do some simple experiments. For that, we try and find out two main things — what all can we change or control when we do the experiment, and what all can we observe to see if these changes made any difference. In this case, we can perhaps think of the changing the thickness and the size of the rolled dough. We could also try to use different types of flour (atta, maida, etc.). While frying the puri, we can also change the temperature of the hot oil, or try and drop the rolled dough into the oil in different ways (drop it vertically? slide it at an angle? slide it slowly?) Notice that these are things that we can control. However, to make sense of the changes, we also need to think of what we can observe or measure. Some of these may have just yes/no answers, in some cases there might be a number we can measure. Maybe we can start by checking whether the puri puffs up (yes/no), or we can measure the time it takes to puff up (seconds). We can check whether a very thick layer of dough still gives a thin side to the puri. Further,"}

Maybe we can start by checking whether the puri puffs up (yes/no), or we can measure the time it takes to puff up (seconds). We can check whether a very thick layer of dough still gives a thin side to the puri. Further, while doing such experiments, it is better to change only one thing at a time while keeping the other conditions same. For example, if we wanted to see the effect of boiling hot, hot, and not very hot oil, we would Chapter 1 — Exploring the Investigative World of Science 7 use circles of dough of the same thickness, and drop them in the same way. It is also a good idea to keep notes of everything that you see and sense when doing an experiment. Did the oil splatter, smell, or smoke? And after doing one round of experiments, you may think of more questions. Do puris puff better when made fresh or from stored dough? What happens if I prick a hole in the puri before frying? This is exactly how all scientific experiments, from simple to the most complicated are done. This is the idea of systematic investigation. And just so you know, even this simple everyday observation — of a puri swelling — is not really completely understood by scientists today! So, whether it is the swelling of a puri or the shrinking bright part of the Moon after purnima, let your careful observations guide you along your explorations into the investigate world of science.

Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 9 The human eye can only see objects that are above a certain size. For a long time, many tiny things around us remained unknown. Long ago, people discovered that a curved piece of glass could make small things look bigger. The piece of glass was shaped like a lentil seed — thick in the middle and thin at the edge — hence they called it a lens. Over time, lenses were improved to become more powerful. Each new tool, from simple magnifying glasses to microscopes, helped humans see what their eyes could not. The invention of the microscope opened a fascinating hidden world filled with tiny living creatures. We will explore some of these life forms in this chapter. You have already learnt about the amazing variety of living beings. Just look around — there are so many beautiful plants and animals! They are of all shapes, sizes, and colours. Some living beings are tiny, while others are really big. They differ not only in their structure but also in many other features.

You might have seen some people using reading glasses. How does it help them see better? Or what happens when we use a magnifying glass to observe something? Activity 2.1: Let us observe z Take a round-bottom flask made up of glass as shown in Fig. 2.1. Fill it with water. z Close the mouth of the flask with a cork. z Now, place the flask on an open book and look at the letters through it. Do you notice something interesting? The letters appear larger when seen through the flask! This happens because the flask filled with water acts like a magnifying glass. Now, use a real magnifying glass to look at small organisms, like an ant. Were you able to see the details of its body more clearly? For a long time, people were curious to explore the tiny organisms around them, but they could not see them with their naked eyes. So, how did we finally discover this invisible world? Do you know which scientific discovery helped us see the tiny world for the first time? Fig. 2.1: Round-bottom flask 10 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Ever heard of ...

In 1665, a scientist named Robert Hooke published a book called Micrographia. He was a careful observer, and a skilled artist. In this book, he showed detailed drawings of tiny things that people had never seen before — things he saw using a tool we now call a microscope. His microscope made things look 200 to 300 times bigger, than what one could see with the unaided eye. One day, he looked at a thin slice of cork and saw it was made of many small, empty spaces. These compartments reminded him of a honeycomb. He drew what he saw and called each small space a cell. This was the first time the word cell was used in science to describe the basic unit of life. Around the same time in 1660s, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, a Dutch scientist, made better lenses that allowed him to build more useful microscopes. He was the first person to clearly see and describe tiny living things like bacteria and blood cells. Because of this, he is known as the Father of Microbiology.

You might wonder what cells actually look like. Let us take a closer look at the basic structure of a cell using a microscope. Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 11 Activity 2.2: Let us study a cell (Teacher demonstration activity) z Take an onion bulb from your kitchen or garden and wash it thoroughly with water. z Cut the onion bulb vertically into pieces. z Take one piece of onion and pull out the thin, transparent layer from its inner surface with the help of forceps. This layer is called the onion peel. z Place the peel in a petri dish containing a few drops of safranin (red-coloured stain) for 30 seconds. This will give a pinkish colour to the cells and help us see them clearly. z With the help of thin brush transfer the onion peel to another petri dish containing water to rinse the peel and remove extra stain. z Now, carefully place the stained onion peel on the glass slide using a thin brush, ensuring it does not break or fold. z Put a drop of glycerin over the onion peel on the slide. The glycerin will prevent drying of the cells and improve clarity for better visualisation of cells. z Slowly place a coverslip over the peel using a needle, such that no air bubbles get trapped. z Use blotting paper to gently wipe off any extra glycerin around the edges of the coverslip. z View the slide under a"}

These are the cells of the onion peel, which are closely arranged without any space between them. Try to observe the peels of the leaves of different plants around you.

What did you observe? You will observe a polygon- shaped structure as shown in Fig. 2.4. These are cheek cells, which form the inner lining of your mouth. What similarities and differences did you observe between the cells of onion peel in Activity 2.2 and human cheek cells in Activity 2.3? You have observed that cells have three main parts — a thin outer lining, a central region, and a small round structure inside it. The outer layer is called the cell membrane. The round structure in the middle is the nucleus, which is also covered by a thin membrane. The space between the cell membrane and nucleus is filled with cytoplasm. These three — cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus — are the basic parts of a cell. Some cells, like onion peel cells, have an extra outer layer called the cell wall. What is the importance of these structures in a cell? What functions do they perform? Are these functions important for the maintenance of life? The cell membrane encloses the cytoplasm and nucleus.

The cell membrane separates one cell from another. It is porous and allows the entry of materials essential for life processes and the exit of waste material. Cytoplasm contains other components of the cell and compounds, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and mineral salts. Most of the life processes take place within the cytoplasm. Fig. 2.4: Mount of human cheek cells Nucleus Cytoplasm Cell membrane Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 13 The nucleus regulates all activities that occur within the cell. It also regulates growth. The cell wall in the plant cell provides rigidity and strength to plants. This is why all cells are arranged compactly with each other and look firm in structure. A step further Cells in all parts of a plant have tiny rod-shaped structures called plastids. Some plastids, like chloroplasts, contain chlorophyll, which makes them green and helps in photosynthesis. In non-green parts, they help in the storage of substances. Plant cells also have a large, empty-looking space called a vacuole. This helps the plant cell store important substances, get rid of waste, and maintain the shape of the cell. This gives strength and support to the plant. In animal cells, vacuoles are usually not present, if present, they are usually small. These small vacuoles store certain substances dissolved in water (Fig. 2.5). So, a cell is not just a simple bag of liquid — it is a complex structure made up of many different parts, each with its own special function to allow the cell, and in turn the entire organism to work.

(The colours are to show different parts of the cell) We have now understood the basic structure of cell. And we now also understand that plant and animal cells differ in shape and structure. Do different animal cells also vary in their shape and structure? 2.1.1 Variation in shape and structure of cells The muscle cell and the nerve cell of a human are shown in Fig. 2.6a and (b). What are the similarities and differences you see in them? A muscle cell (Fig. 2.6a) is shaped like a spindle, while a nerve cell (Fig. 2.6b) is very long and has branches. Similarly, some cells are round in shape, while others are long and thin. The number of cells also varies in different organisms. Why do cells look so different from each other? Does the shape and structure of a cell relate to its function? (a) Muscle cell (b) Nerve cell Fig. 2.6: Different cells in humans 14 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The unique shape, size, and structure of cells help them carry out their specific functions.

They form a protective lining on the inner surface of the cheek. Nerve cells also known as neurons carry messages in our body. The elongated shape and branched structure help them reach different parts of the body and pass on messages quickly. Similarly, plant cells also show variation. In plants, too, cells may be rectangular, elongated, oval, or even tube-like. Some plant cells form long tubes that help carry water throughout the plant. You have already studied the digestive system in Grade 7. Different parts of the digestive system are made up of different types of cells. A group of muscle cells are present in the food pipe. These cells contract and relax in a wave-like manner, pushing the food down to the stomach. This movement is possible because muscle cells are thin, flexible, and spindle-shaped. The stomach also has different types of cells for performing different functions. Muscle cells in the stomach wall help churn the food. Other cells in the inner lining of the stomach produce digestive juices and acid that help break down the food. All these cells work together to make digestion possible. 2.2 What Are the Levels of Organisation in the Body of a Living Organism? The body of a living organism is organised in a complex way. Cell (Fig. 2.7a), is the basic unit of life, just like a brick is the basic unit of wall (Fig. 2.3d). A group of similar cells forms a type of tissue (Fig. 2.7b). Different tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several organs work together to form an organ system that performs a major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together make up"}

Different tissues are organised to form an organ (Fig. 2.7c). Several organs work together to form an organ system that performs a major function of the body (Fig. 2.7d). All the organ systems together make up a complete organism (Fig. 2.7e) — like a plant or an animal. So, the levels of organisations are: Cell Tissue Organ Organ system Organism These levels of organisation help us understand how simple building blocks like cells come together to form a complex living being. The life of complex living organisms begins with a single cell— ‘egg’. The egg of any organism has an amazing ability to divide repeatedly to form a complete living being made up of many cells. Such living beings are called multicellular organisms. Animals, including humans, and plants are all examples of multicellular organisms.

The yolk (the yellow part of an egg) of an ostrich egg is a single cell — the largest known cell in the living world — measuring about 130 mm to 170 mm in diameter. The egg contains extra non-cellular material: a shell for protection and a white liquid that nourishes the cell during its continued development. 2.3 What Are Microorganisms? Some living organisms are made up of just one or very few cells. They are so small that they can not be seen with the naked eye. These are called microorganisms.

Some microorganisms, like bacteria and Amoeba, are made of just one cell (unicellular). Others, like some fungi and algae, have many cells (multicellular). They are found all around us — in water, soil, air, and even inside our body! But what do their cells look like? Are they like the plant and animal cells we just learnt about, or are they different? To observe the cells of a microorganism, again, we need to use a microscope which magnifies their size and makes them visible to us. Scientists have also created a low-cost and foldable paper microscope or foldscope. Foldscopes may not provide the same level of details like high-powered laboratory microscopes. However, these make microscopic world accessible to many people. Let us now take a closer look at the fascinating world of microbes. Activity 2.4: Let us observe pond water/ stagnant water z Take a container and collect pond or stagnant water in it with the help of your teacher or elder(s). z Use a dropper and place a drop of pond or stagnant water on a microscope or foldscope slide.

Keep it aside for some time and let the mixture settle. z Use a dropper and take a drop of water from the top layer. Place the drop on a microscope slide. z Cover it gently with a coverslip and observe it under the microscope (Fig. 2.8). You may observe small moving organisms similar to those you saw in Activity 2.4. This indicates that even soil suspension contains a variety of tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the unaided eye. The tiny creatures that cannot be seen with the naked eye are called microorganisms (micro means very small; organisms means living beings) or microbes. Activity 2.6: Let us study A group of students studying in Grade 8 performed Activities 2.4 and 2.5. They also collected information from the library and internet. They recorded the data obtained after observing pond water in Table 2.1 and the data obtained after observing soil suspension in Table 2.2. They identified the microorganisms as protozoa, algae, fungi, and bacteria. You can record if you find any of these categories of organisms.

Ever heard of ... Viruses are microscopic and acellular. Viruses multiply when they enter a living cell. They may infect plants, animals, or bacterial cells and may cause a disease. 18 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 2.4 How Are We Connected to Microbes? Can we find microorganisms in other places, too? Let us have a discussion: Have you ever seen a lemon, tomato, orange, or any other food item rot after being left outside for some time?

How did they come in contact with the food? This happens because microorganisms can be found everywhere, be it in water, soil, air, or even in some food items. You can use a foldscope or a microscope to explore surfaces of leaves, stems, roots, or any other part to see them. Like plants and animals, microorganisms also show great diversity. Some of them can even be found in extreme climatic conditions, such as hot water springs and snow cold zones as well as at moderate temperatures. You already know some of these organisms live inside our bodies, especially in our gut! You have studied in the chapter ‘Life Processes in Animals’ in Curiosity, Grade 7 that our intestine has many bacteria that help in digestion. Like plants and animals, microorganisms vary in shape, size, and structure. In Tables 2.1 and 2.2, you would have observed microorganisms of different shapes — spherical, rod-shape, or irregular. How does the diversity of microorganisms play a role in our daily life? How do they help clean the environment? 2.4.1 Key players in cleaning the environment Let us attempt to understand this by doing an activity.

Fig. 2.9: Fruit with microorganism growing on it Chapter 2 — The Invisible Living World: Beyond Our Naked Eye 19 z After 2–3 weeks, observe the changes that have taken place. z Do you observe any difference in the contents of the container? You may find that peels of fruits and vegetables have turned into a dark-coloured material. This is manure, which is rich in nutrients and helps increase the fertility of the soil. But how did the peels of fruits and vegetables turn into manure? In Activity 2.6, you saw that soil contains various kinds of microorganisms. Some of these microorganisms, like fungi and bacteria, act on the plant waste and slowly break it down into simpler, nutrient-rich manure. You may have seen gardeners in your school or in a field near your house collecting dry leaves and plant waste and putting them into pits. Do you now understand why they do this? It is to make natural manure. Ancient Indian texts, particularly the Vedas, have references of the word ‘Krimi’ which means different tiny entities including ‘Drishya’ (visible) and ‘Adrishya’ (invisible). Various Vedic texts mention their beneficial and harmful effects. Atharvaveda also refers to ‘Krimi’.

Various Vedic texts mention their beneficial and harmful effects. Atharvaveda also refers to ‘Krimi’. Our scientific heritage If you look around carefully, you might see decaying plants and fallen leaves stored in a container or lying in the garden, disappear after some time from the surroundings. This is because microorganisms breakdown and turn them into simpler substances rich in nutrients. These nutrients go back to the soil and help plants grow better. Microorganisms also decompose bodies of dead animals. So, microbes help recycle the waste and return important nutrients to nature. Manure formation occurs at optimal temperature and appropriate moisture level. Isn’t it interesting? By now, you must have understood that bacteria and some fungi are types of microorganisms that play an important role in our lives. And guess what, these helpful bacteria can also decompose animal wastes like dung! From Activity 2.7, we can also infer that microorganisms not only help in plant growth, but also clean our environment by breaking down waste. Fig. 2.10: Recycling of nutrients by making manure 20 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Now, think what would have happened if microorganisms did not exist on Earth? A step further Microbes as a source of biogas Many microorganisms, like bacteria and fungi, live in an oxygen- free environment. Some of these bacteria have the ability to decompose plant and animal waste present in the environment or household wastewater. During the process, they release a mixture of gases containing carbon dioxide, and a high proportion of another gas, methane. This gas has been used as a fuel source for cooking, heating, generating electricity, and to even run vehicles.

In 1971, he developed a special bacterium that could break down oil spills, helping to clean the environment. His discovery received a patent in 1980. Patent is a copyright given to a person so that no one else can copy, use or sell his/her invention without permission. His work showed how microorganisms could be used to solve environmental problems like pollution. He is remembered for his contributions to science and for protecting the environment using microbes. What are the other problems which you think can be solved with the help of microorganisms? How does the diversity of microorganisms help in our kitchen? 2.4.2 Microorganisms and food Let us try to understand by performing activities in the kitchen. Activity 2.8: Let us perform z Take two bowls A and B. z In each, take 200 g of flour (atta or maida) and add a pinch of sugar. z Now, in bowl A, add a small amount of yeast powder and mix it well with the flour. z In bowl B, do not add any yeast, so that we can compare the results of the two bowls. z Knead the flour of the two bowls with warm water to make soft dough (Fig. 2.11).

Did you find any change in the volume, smell, or texture of the dough? If not, leave the dough for some more time. After some time, you may notice that the dough in bowl A, where yeast was added, has risen slightly, become fluffy, and has a different smell compared to the dough kneaded without yeast. Why does this happen? What is the role of yeast? Why did we add sugar and warm water to the flour? Yeast is a type of microorganism. It belongs to a group of microorganisms, called fungi. Yeast grows well in warm conditions. You may recall from chapter ‘Life Process in Animals’ in Grade 7 that, like other organisms, yeast also respires and breaks down food to release energy for their growth and carry out life processes. During this process, carbon dioxide is released, which forms bubbles that makes the dough soft and fluffy. Yeast also produces a small amount of alcohol during this process, which gives the dough a slightly different smell. This special property of yeast is used in the process of making breads, cakes, and more! In addition to yeast, some bacteria, such as Lactobacillus, help in fermentation of batter for making idli and dosa, and dough for making bhatura.

Keep bowl A in a warm place and bowl B in a cool place (like a refrigerator) for a few hours or overnight. z Observe the changes in the glass bowls. Write your predictions and observations in Table 2.4. Table 2.4: Testing for curd formation using milk in different conditions Change in the appearance of milk Change in the colour of milk Possible reason Bowl A Bowl B Bowl A Bowl B Prediction Observation 22 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 You will observe that in bowl A, the milk has turned into curd after a few hours and has become little sour. Whereas in bowl B, the milk has not curdled, but it might be a little sour. Do you know why this happens? The curd contains several types of bacteria. One of them is Lactobacillus. This bacterium feeds on the sugar in the milk (lactose), multiplies, and ferments the milk to form curd. Instead of producing alcohol (like yeast), these bacteria produce lactic acid, which makes curd sour. These bacteria grow well in warm conditions. That is why curd is formed in bowl A but not in bowl B. We can categorise the microorganisms into different categories, such as protozoa, fungi, bacteria, some algae, and more. Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. Roots"}

Some bacteria, such as Rhizobium, form the swollen regions called nodules and live in them as shown in Fig. 2.12. Roots of certain legumes, such as beans, peas, and lentils have root nodules that contain Rhizobium bacteria. These bacteria trap nitrogen from the air and make it useful for the plants. This helps plants grow better without chemical fertilisers. That is why farmers grow legumes in rotation with other crops. This naturally increases the nitrogen in the soil and keeps it healthy for the next crop. 2.4.3 Amazing microalgae: tiny helpers in water Microalgae are microscopic plant-like organisms that live in water, soil, air, and even on trees. They make their own food using sunlight. While doing this, they also release oxygen and produce more than half of the Earth’s oxygen supply. They are rich in nutrients and serve as a food source for many aquatic animals. Some, like Spirulina, Chlorella, and Diatoms, are also used by humans as health supplements and medicines. Microalgae also help in cleaning water and are used to make biofuel. However, pollution, climate change, and habitat destruction are threatening microalgal diversity and abundance. It is important to conserve these tiny organisms to protect the environment and maintain oxygen balance on Earth.

Spirulina, a microalga, is called a superfood because of its health benefits. Spirulina is also a good source of vitamin B12, which is essential for our body. It has a lot of protein— more than 60 per cent of its body weight—and only a small amount of fat and sugar. Nowadays, farming of Spirulina is becoming a feasible livelihood opportunity. You can grow Spirulina easily by following these steps: 1. \u0007Set a clear glass tank in a bright place away from direct sunlight. 2. \u0007Cover the tank with a shade net, or keep the tank at a place with moderate temperature conditions. 3. \u0007Fill the tank with pond water. 4. \u0007Add living Spirulina collected from a pond. 5. \u0007Stir the growing Spirulina twice a week. 6. \u0007After 3–6 weeks, Spirulina may be harvested from the tank by filtering it through a fine cloth. Conservation of microalgae is a good practice for ensuring food security and livelihood development. 2.5 \u0007Why Is Cell Considered to Be a Basic Unit of Life? The body of all living organisms are made up of tiny building blocks called cells. A single cell contains various components that help organisms perform various functions. The bodies of all plants and animals are made up of many cells. Therefore, they are called multicellular (many-celled) organisms. In multicellular organisms, cells carry out specialised functions individually but also cooperate with each other to increase the chance of survival. Some microorganisms, such as bacteria and protozoa, are made up of just one cell. These are called unicellular (single-celled) organisms. They carry out all the functions necessary for their survival in a single cell. Other microbes, like algae and fungi, are made up of one or more cells. For example, yeast is"}

For example, yeast is a unicellular fungus while mould is a multicellular fungus. Nucleoid Fig. 2.13: A bacterial cell showing the nucleoid region 24 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Like animal and plant cells, the cells of microorganisms are also surrounded by a cell membrane. Cells of fungi additionally have a cell wall, but they do not have chloroplasts, so they cannot make their own food through photosynthesis. Bacteria do not have a well-defined nucleus and a nuclear membrane. Instead they have a nucleoid. This feature distinguishes them from cells of yeast, protozoa, algae, fungi, plants, and animals. We have only looked at a few basic cell structures here. The cell has other components about which you will learn in higher classes. For observing subcellular components, we need microscopes with high magnification. An electron microscope magnifies the cell about 10,00,000 times, where we can see more structures present in a cell. By now, you must have understood that all living beings, including microorganisms, are made up of one or more cells. Their cells differ in size, shape, and structure. Plant and animal cells also have some differences. Understanding these differences helps us learn how these organisms function differently. In this chapter, we have learnt about the beneficial microorganisms. However, there are some microbes that cause diseases in plants and animals including humans.

The school counsellor arranged help to support him in making friends and improving his health. Think and Reflect: What was the cause of the boy’s health problems? How did his habits and surroundings affect his well-being? As per the World Health Organization (WHO), health is defined as a ‘state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being, and not merely the absence of disease’ (Fig. 3.1). A healthy person can perform various tasks more efficiently and cope well in different and difficult situations. A healthy person can adjust well with peer groups and other members of society. Let us understand more about health. Ayurveda teaches us that true health is a balance of body, mind, and surroundings. Following dinacharya (daily routine) and ritucharya (seasonal routine) helps maintain this balance. Eating fresh, wholesome food suited to one’s prakriti (body constitution) is essential. Regular exercise, cleanliness, restful sleep, and a calm mind support overall well-being. This can also be achieved through practices like yoga, meditation, and mindfulness.

Our body usually works in a certain way to keep us healthy. When we feel unwell, it means something inside us may not be working as it should. We may have symptoms, such as pain, tiredness, or dizziness, and signs like fever, rash, high blood pressure, or swelling that indicate we are unwell. A symptom is what we feel (like pain), while a sign is something that can be seen or measured (like high body temperature when we have fever). These help doctors understand what might be making us unwell. (a) (b) Fig. 3.3: Two different playgrounds 32 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 3.4 Diseases: What Are the Causes and Types?

Some examples of communicable diseases are typhoid, dengue, flu, chickenpox, and COVID-19. In recent years, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) like diabetes, heart disease, and cancer have become more common in India. This is happening because of changes in how people live — such as eating more processed food, getting less exercise, and living longer lives. Today, most deaths in India are caused by NCDs. Understanding the difference between these two types helps us know how diseases spread and how to prevent them. 3.4.1 How are communicable diseases caused and spread? All communicable diseases are caused by pathogens. These pathogens can enter our body through the air we breathe or by consuming contaminated food or water and more. But how do these pathogens spread from one person to another? One common way is through air, when an infected person coughs or sneezes, or through direct contact like shaking hands, or indirectly by sharing Fig. 3.4: Common methods of transmission of diseases Infected person Healthy person Mosquito insects By food Direct contact Indirect contact By air Healthy person Rabid animal Chapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure 33 personal items of an infected person.

Some infectious diseases are caused by worms that live inside our bodies, especially in the digestive system. They feed on nutrients and live as parasites — organisms that live in or on another living being. These worms usually spread through contaminated food, water, soil, or contact with infected people or animals. 3.4.2 How are non-communicable diseases caused? You learnt that non-communicable diseases like cancer, diabetes, and asthma are linked to lifestyle, diet, and/or environment. They are the most common cause of death in India. In Grade 6, you also learnt about diseases like scurvy, anaemia, and goitre, Are diseases always caused by infections? 36 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 which are caused by a lack of specific nutrients in the diet. These are called deficiency diseases and are also non-communicable. Diseases such as cancer, diabetes, and asthma may often persist for a long time (more than 3 months) and are referred to as chronic diseases. Diabetes is a common disease which is becoming more prevalent in adults as well as children. In fact, India now has one of the highest numbers of people with diabetes in the world. It often develops due to a combination of hormonal imbalances, unhealthy eating habits, lack of physical activity, being overweight or obese, and other reasons.

Activity 3.6: Let us read Odisha — community-led sanitation campaign In Bhadrak district, Odisha, a community sanitation campaign helped more people build and use toilets. This reduced open defecation significantly, and improved child health, with fewer cases of diarrhoea and infections. What do you infer from this case study? Simple steps like good sanitation can greatly reduce the spread of communicable diseases. Find about such community campaigns held in your location. Share in your class and discuss with your peers about the impact of such initiatives. Ability of the body to fight diseases You would have noticed that some people get sick more frequently than others, although living in a similar environment. Do you know why? The natural ability of our body to fight diseases is known as immunity. Our body has a special system called the immune system that helps fight against diseases. You might have taken some drops or injections in your childhood to protect yourself from certain diseases, such as polio, measles, tetanus, and hepatitis. These are vaccines that help prevent serious infections caused by viruses and bacteria. A vaccine helps our body fight certain diseases by training the immune system to recognise and attack harmful germs. providing what is known as acquired immunity — protection developed after exposure to a pathogen or a vaccine. Vaccines can be made in different ways — from weakened or dead pathogens (like viruses or bacteria), or from inactive or harmless parts of the pathogen. Some newer vaccines instruct our own body cells 38 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 to make a harmless part of the germ, which our immune system then learns to fight. For example, a"}

For example, a tetanus shot, often given after an injury protects against infection by the tetanus-causing bacteria. It contains an inactivated bacterial toxin that helps the immune system develop protection without causing the disease. Do you know when the first vaccine was discovered? Edward Jenner and the smallpox vaccine Smallpox was a deadly disease that caused blisters and killed millions. A milder disease called cowpox, seen in cows, could also infect humans. In the late 1700s, English doctor Edward Jenner discovered that people who had cowpox did not get smallpox. This led to the invention of the first vaccine and helped protect people from smallpox. Our scientific heritage Long before modern vaccines, India had a traditional method called variolation to protect against smallpox. It involved using material from a smallpox sore to scratch the skin and create a mild infection and build immunity. People who performed this practice were known as teekedaars. Think like a scientist Observations Jenner observed that milkmaids who had cowpox did not catch smallpox, likely because the two viruses are related. Results He found that people who were infected with cowpox sap were now resistant to smallpox. Application Mass vaccination eventually helped eradicate smallpox worldwide. Experimentation He tested this by injecting cowpox sap into a boy, who later showed no illness when exposed to smallpox.

Year Chapter 3 — Health: The Ultimate Treasure 39 Vaccines are one of the most effective ways to protect people of all ages — from infants to the elderly — against many serious diseases. They help prevent illnesses, reduce the spread of infections, and save millions of lives every year. It is important to remember that vaccines are preventive, not curative — they can help minimise serious diseases before they happen, but do not treat them once someone is already sick. Some people may fear or doubt vaccines, but scientists and doctors carefully test them for safety. Getting vaccinated not only protects you but also the people around you. Ever heard of ... India’s Role in Vaccine Production India is one of the world’s largest vaccine producers. It manufactures vaccines on a massive scale and supplies them to many countries. Indian vaccine companies played a key role during the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to support global health efforts. Be a scientist Dr. Maharaj Kishan Bhan was a well-known Indian doctor and scientist. As Secretary of the Department of Biotechnology, he helped promote science and innovation in India. He played a key role in developing the Rotavirus vaccine, which protects children from diarrhoea. He believed in using research to create affordable healthcare and made a big difference in India’s health and biotechnology sectors. 3.5.1 Treatment of diseases If our immune system fails to protect us against an infectious disease, we fall ill and need to visit a doctor.

The doctor may give us medicines called antibiotics, which kill the bacteria that might have caused the disease. Antibiotics work only against bacterial infections because they target parts of bacterial cells that are different from human or other animal cells. They do not work against viruses or diseases caused by protozoa. 40 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Think like a scientist Discovery of the first antibiotic, Penicillin Penicillin was discovered in 1928 by Alexander Fleming, a bacteriologist from London. While studying harmful bacteria, he noticed that a mould on a discarded petri dish stopped the bacteria from growing. He realized the mould released a substance that killed the bacteria. This chance discovery led to the discovery of penicillin, the first antibiotic used to treat bacterial infections. Though antibiotics are effective in protecting us against bacterial infections and have saved millions of lives since their discovery, their indiscriminate use has led to a decline in their effectiveness (Fig. 3.5a). Nowadays, there are news headlines about antibiotic resistance, a phenomenon where bacteria that were earlier killed by a given antibiotic are found to survive and multiply despite treatment with that antibiotic. This makes HOW ANTIBIOTIC RESISTANCE SPREADS IN THE COMMUNITY?

What precautions may be taken to reduce antibiotic resistance? z To tackle the problem of antibiotic resistance, we must use antibiotics wisely — only when prescribed by a doctor, in the correct dose, and for the right duration. Avoiding unnecessary use helps prevent the rise of resistant bacteria and keeps antibiotics effective for future generations.

Mohini and Aakarsh, along with their friends, went from one exhibit to another, eagerly exploring different models, asking questions and taking notes. One simple model really fascinated them. It was a working model of a lifting electromagnet which was displayed by their senior, Sumana. In it, instead of a hook like a typical crane, there was an iron nail wrapped with a wire, which was connected to a battery. When Sumana closed the circuit, the nail picked up iron paper clips like a magnet. When she opened the circuit, the clips fell off. Mohini and Aakarsh, were surprised. They remembered learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’, Curiosity, Grade 6) that magnetic materials were attracted by magnet and that iron was a magnetic material. But in Sumana’s model, there was no magnet, only an electric circuit. They were so excited that they wanted to try it out themselves. 4.1 \u0007Does an Electric Current Have a Magnetic Effect?

But why does the compass needle deflect when the current flows through the wire? The deflection indicates that the current carrying wire has a magnetic effect on the compass needle. When the current stops, this magnetic effect disappears and the compass needle returns to its original direction. The region around a magnet or a current carrying wire where its magnetic effect can be felt, such as by the deflection of a compass needle, is said to have a magnetic field. When electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it. This phenomenon is known as the magnetic effect of electric current. The magnetic field disappears when the current stops flowing. Be a scientist You have just now made the same discovery which was made by the scientist Hans Christian Oersted (1777–1851) in 1820, that is, the discovery that electricity and magnetism are linked. He was a professor at a university in Denmark. It is said that once while giving a demonstration, he noticed that whenever an electrical circuit was closed or opened, the needle of a magnetic compass, lying nearby, deflected. He investigated this and when he was certain that an electric current indeed produced a magnetic field, he published his findings.

Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects 49 The magnetic effect of electric current has many practical applications, such as in devices like electromagnets, electric bells, motors, fans, loudspeakers, and more. 4.1.1 Electromagnets Activity 4.2: Let us explore z Take around 50 cm long length of a flexible insulated wire, an iron nail, an electric cell, and few iron paper clips. z Tightly wrap the wire around the nail in the form of a coil, as shown in Fig. 4.2, and secure it with an adhesive tape. z Connect the ends of the wire to the cell. Take care to not connect the wires to the cell for more than a few seconds; otherwise, the cell may weaken quickly. z Bring the nail close to the iron paper clips and lift up. Do the clips hang to the ends of the nail? z Disconnect the wire from the cell to stop the flow of electric current in the wire. Do the clips fall down?

Is there any difference in the deflection of the compass needles? z Place some iron paper clips near the two ends of the nail. Are the clips attracted to the ends of the nail? It is observed that when current is passed through the cylindrical coil, it behaves like a magnet and deflects the needle of a magnetic compass. When an iron nail is inserted in the core of the coil, then the coil becomes a stronger magnet and the deflection of the magnetic compass needle is much more. It also attracts iron clips (Fig. 4.3e). When the current is stopped, the cylindrical coil loses its magnetic effect. A current carrying coil that behaves as a magnet is called an electromagnet. For practical applications, most electromagnets have an iron core to make them stronger. Does electromagnet also have two poles like a bar magnet? Activity 4.4: Let us investigate z Take the electromagnet made in Activity 4.3 and a magnetic compass. Label the two ends of the coil as A and B. z Place the magnetic compass near the end A of the coil as shown in Fig. 4.4a. z Connect the coil to the cell and observe the compass.

Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects 51 As we have learnt earlier, when two magnets are brought close to each other, their unlike poles (North–South) attract each other.

Did you find that the polarity of end B is opposite to the polarity of end A? We learnt in grade 6 that a magnet has two poles. Just like a magnet, an electromagnet also has two poles — North and South. Think like a scientist Repeat Activity 4.3 with — (i) 2 and 4 cells with the same coil, (ii) 2 cells but different number of turns of the coil. What do you observe? A single cell provides only a small amount of current, so the magnetic field is weak. As a result, the deflection of compass needle is less and the coil can only attract a few clips. A battery with more cells gives a larger current as compared to that with a single cell. This creates a stronger magnetic field, so the deflection of the compass needle is more and the coil can attract more clips. The increase in number of turns of the coil also makes the coil a stronger magnet! Also, repeat Activity 4.4 by changing the direction of the current. So, the strength of an electromagnet can be changed by changing the amount of electric current flowing through the coil or the number of turns of the coil, or both. Also, its poles can be reversed by changing the direction of the current.

Do you remember learning earlier (in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6) that a freely suspended magnet rests along the north–south direction because our Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet? But why does Earth behave like a magnet? Deep inside the Earth, the movement of liquid iron in the core creates electric currents, which generate a magnetic field. Many migratory birds, fish, and animals use this field to navigate across continents and oceans. The Earth’s magnetic field also acts as a shield, blocking harmful particles from space, and helps protect life on Earth.

The crane operator can control the magnet by switching the current ON and OFF. When the current is turned ON, the electromagnet lifts the iron/steel objects; when the current is switched OFF, magnetic field disappears, and the objects are released. Lifting electromagnets are widely used in factories and scrap yards, to move, lift, and sort heavy metal items efficiently. A step further We have learnt that when electric current flows through a conductor (like a wire), it produces a magnetic field around it.

Activity 4.5: Let us observe In this activity, we will use a special kind of wire, called a nichrome wire. z Take a cardboard piece of about 10 cm length and 10 cm width, two nails, a nichrome wire of thickness about 0.3 mm (26–28 gauge) and length of 10 cm, an electric cell, a cell holder, a switch, and connecting wires. z Mount the nails on the cardboard about 5 cm apart. z Tie the nichrome wire between these nails and make the connections as shown in Fig. 4.5 with the switch in OFF position. z Touch the nichrome wire. What do you feel? z Move the switch to ON position for about 30 s and then move it back to OFF. Touch the nichrome wire momentarily While doing the activity for electromagnet, did you also notice that the wire ends got warm? Why would that happen? Are electromagnets also used in real life, for lifting objects? Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects 53 (Do not hold the nichrome wire). What difference do you feel? z Repeat the last two steps to confirm the observation. You may have observed that nichrome wire feels warm when current is passed through it.

This happens because, when electric current flows through any conductor, it faces some opposition or resistance to its flow. Different conductors offer different levels of resistance to the flow of current. A nichrome wire, for example, offers higher resistance compared to a copper wire of the same size and length. This resistance causes some of the electrical energy to be converted into heat energy. When an electric current passes through a conductor, it gets heated. This warming is known as the heating effect of electric current. Think like a scientist This activity should be carried out strictly under the supervision of a teacher. Repeat Activity 4.5 with a battery of 2 cells. What do you notice? For the same duration, does the wire heat up more with one cell or two cells? The amount of heat generated is more in the experiment with 2 cells. This is due to the fact that the heat generated depends on the magnitude of the electric current. The heat generated in a wire depends on the material, thickness, and length of the wire, and the duration for which the current flows. In Grade 7, we have learnt that an incandescent lamp glows because its filament is heated by an electric current. Many household appliances, such as electric room heaters, stoves, irons, immersion rods, water heaters, kettles, and hair dryers (Fig. 4.6) work on the same principle of the heating effect of electric current.

Safety First Safety first Do not touch the wire for an extended period to avoid any injuries. 54 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The heating effect of electric current is useful in many everyday appliances. But sometimes, it can cause problems, like energy loss in wires during transmission. Overheating in appliances may cause damage to plugs and sockets where plastic parts may melt, or even lead to fires. In household circuits, there are safety devices placed in the circuit to minimise such incidents. Ever heard of ... Beyond household use, heating effect of electric current has several industrial applications.

A step further Chapter 4 — Electricity: Magnetic and Heating Effects 55 Yes, but have you ever wondered what is inside these cells and batteries that produces electricity? The portable sources of electricity, such as cells and batteries, are so fascinating. Using these, we could light up a small lamp, make a magnet, and heat up a wire. 4.3 How Does a Battery Generate Electricity? Let us start with one of the earliest types of electric cells ever made. 4.3.1 Voltaic cell A Voltaic cell, also known as Galvanic cell, is shown in Fig. 4.7. It contains two metal plates made of different materials and a liquid called an electrolyte, placed in a glass or plastic container. The plates, called electrodes, are partly dipped in the electrolyte, which is usually a weak acid or salt solution. A chemical reaction between the plates and the electrolyte produces electricity. When the circuit is connected, electric current flows from the positive terminal through the circuit to the negative terminal. Over time, the chemicals get used up, and the cell stops working. It is then called ‘dead’ and cannot supply any more electricity. Ever heard of ... The Voltaic or Galvanic cells get their names from two Italian scientists, Alessandro Volta and Luigi Galvani. In the late 1700s, Galvani noticed that a dead frog’s leg kicked when touched with two different metals — copper and iron. It was already known by then that electricity could stimulate muscular motion and Galvani thought the electricity came from the frog itself. But Volta had a different idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and not the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of the frog’s"}

But Volta had a different idea. He believed the electricity came from the metals, and not the frog. To test this, he used saltwater-soaked paper instead of the frog’s leg and still got an electric current. This showed that it was the combination of metals and liquid that generated electric current — leading to the invention of the first battery!

A glowing LED indicates that your cell is working. In this cell, the metal electrodes are the copper wires and the iron nails. The electrolyte is the lemon juice, which helps conduct electricity. You may also use salt solutions instead of lemon juice. A step further Some common metal pairs for Voltaic cells are zinc/copper, zinc/ silver, aluminium/copper, iron/copper, magnesium/copper, and lead/copper. Some metals — like copper — act as positive electrodes, yet some other metals — like zinc — act as negative electrodes. This is due to their chemical properties. We will learn more about this in the higher grades. Can we also make our own Voltaic cell using easily available materials?

Instead, dry cells are one of the most widely used electric cells today. They are called ‘dry’ because the electrolyte is not a liquid but a thick moist paste. The structure of a dry cell is shown in Fig. 4.9. It consists of a zinc container which acts as a negative terminal and a carbon rod at the centre covered with metal cap that acts as the positive terminal. The carbon rod is surrounded by the paste-like electrolyte. The dry cell is a single use cell, meaning once it is used up, it has to be disposed of.

The force applied on an object may z make an object move from rest. z change the speed of an object if it is moving. z change the direction of motion of an object. z bring about a change in the shape of an object. z cause some or all of these effects. 5.3 \u0007Are Forces an Interaction Between Two or More Objects?

When you push a table, your hand is one object applying force on another object — the table. Here, we say that your hand and the table are two objects interacting with each other. Think of all the actions listed in Table 5.1. How many objects are involved in each of the actions? Do you notice that forces result only when two objects are interacting in some way or the other? From these examples, we can infer that at least two objects must interact for a force to come into play. A force is a push or pull on an object resulting from the object’s interaction with another object. The SI unit of force is newton (written with a small ‘n’) and its symbol is N. A step further Suppose an object is at rest. Does it mean that no force is acting on this object? It means that the forces acting on the object are balancing one another. You will learn about balanced forces in higher grades. Does this mean that whenever there is a change in speed or direction, or change in shape, a force is acting on the object? Yes, none of these take place without the action of force. 66 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Fig. 5.3: Use of muscular force by living beings A step further When you pushed the table with your hand, did you feel a force on your hand too?

The moment you stopped pushing, the force on your hand disappeared. Whenever two objects interact, each object experiences a force from the other. As soon as the interaction ceases, the two objects no longer experience the force. 5.4 What Are the Different Types of Forces? 5.4.1 Contact forces In many situations, we find that to apply a force on an object, physical contact is necessary between our body and the object. This contact can be direct, such as using our hands or other body parts, or indirect, such as using a stick or rope. Forces of this type which act only when there is physical contact between the objects are called contact forces. Muscular force An example of contact force is muscular force. When we perform any physical activity, such as walking, running, lifting, pushing, jumping, or stretching, the force is caused by the action of muscles in our body. The force resulting due to the action of muscles is known as muscular force. Muscular force occurs when muscles contract and elongate while doing any activity. Animals, birds, fish, and insects use muscular forces for movement and survival. Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces 67 Humans used the muscular force of some animals to carry out many tasks for a long time. Fig. 5.4: Use of muscular force of animals to assist with human tasks Ever heard of ... Muscular force plays an important role in many functions inside our body too.

The expansion and contraction of our heart muscles allows the blood to circulate in our body — a process essential for survival. Friction A ball rolling on a flat ground stops on its own after some time. If we stop pedalling our bicycle on a flat road, it slows down and comes to a stop. If the road is rough, it stops sooner than on a smoother road. You must have come across many such experiences. What causes the change in the speed of objects in such situations? We have learnt earlier that a force is essential to change the speed of an object. However, in all these situations no force appears to be acting on the objects, yet their speed gradually decreases and they come to a stop after some time. Is it possible that some force is indeed acting on them? Which force is that? Activity 5.3: Let us investigate z Take an object with a flat base (such as an empty lunch box/ geometry box/ a notebook) and place it on a table or floor. z Gently push it and observe. Does it stop after travelling some distance? Is there a force acting on it which brings it to rest? z Now repeat by pushing the object in the opposite direction. Does it stop again after travelling some distance? Is there any other contact force? 68 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 On pushing, the object stops after sliding a certain distance.

This must be due to a force acting between the surfaces of the sliding object and the table or floor which are in contact. This force must be acting on the object in a direction opposite to its direction of motion. This force is what brings the object to a stop. The force that comes into play when an object moves or tries to move over another surface is called the force of friction or simply friction. Friction always acts in a direction opposite to the direction in which the object is moving or trying to move. The force of friction is a contact force since it arises due to two surfaces in contact. Friction arises due to the irregularities in the two surfaces in contact. Even surfaces which appear smooth, have a large number of minute irregularities (Fig. 5.6). When placed in contact, the irregularities of two surfaces lock into each other and oppose any effort to move one surface over the other. Fig. 5.6: Friction between two surfaces due to irregularities Fig. 5.5: Friction acts between two surfaces and opposes the motion of the object. Activity 5.4: Let us explore z Try Activity 5.3 again, but this time place the same object on different surfaces, such as glass, cloth, wood, ceramic tile, and sand. z Does the object stop after travelling the same distance as in Activity 5.3? z Does the object stop at the same distance on all surfaces?

Friction is greater on rough surfaces. A step further Does the force or friction act only if the objects are moving on solid surfaces? What about objects moving through liquids and gases? Air, water, and other liquids also exert force of friction on the objects moving through them. Hence the objects, such as aeroplanes, ships, boats, or high-speed trains are designed with specific shapes to reduce the force of friction due to the air or water around them. Does this mean that the force of friction will be greater if the surfaces are rough? Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces 69 5.4.2 Non-contact forces There are forces whose effect can be experienced even if the objects are not in contact. These forces are called non-contact forces. Let us learn about non-contact forces. Magnetic force Do you remember learning about magnets in the chapter ‘Exploring Magnets’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? We learnt that a magnet attracts objects made of magnetic materials. When two magnets are brought close to each other, like poles (North–North, South–South) repel each other while unlike poles (North–South) attract each other. In an earlier chapter of this book, we also learnt about electromagnets which behave like magnets. Attraction and repulsion between objects are also a form of push and pull, that is, a force. Can you recall that a magnet could exert force on another magnet or a magnetic material without being in contact with it?

Activity 5.5: Let us test z Take two ring magnets and a wooden stick. z While holding the stick in a vertical position over a wooden table, insert one ring magnet onto the stick (Fig. 5.7). z Now insert the second ring magnet above it such that the like poles of the two magnets face each other. Does the second magnet stay floating above the first magnet? z Try pushing the second magnet down gently. Do you feel a force on it? z Now, reverse the poles of both the magnets. Does the second magnet still remain floating? We find that a magnet can exert force on another magnet without being in contact with it. The force exerted by a magnet on another magnet or a magnetic material is called magnetic force. Since a magnet can exert a force from a distance without being in contact it is called a non-contact force. Are there more such forces which act from a distance? Fig. 5.7: Force between two ring magnets Is it essential for an object applying force on another object to always be in contact with it? 70 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Electrostatic force Activity 5.6: Let us experiment z Take a plastic scale or a plastic straw, a piece of polythene, and small pieces of paper. z Rub plastic scale/straw vigorously with polythene. z Do not touch the rubbed part with your hand or any metal object. z Now, bring it close to the small pieces of paper placed on a table, taking care not to touch the paper pieces (Fig. 5.8).

Do you notice something surprising? The paper pieces get pulled towards the plastic scale/straw and stick to it when it is brought close to paper pieces. Why does this happen? When two objects of certain materials are rubbed together, electrical charges build up on their surfaces. These charges are called static charges as they do not move by themselves. The object that acquires static charges is said to be a charged object. A charged object attracts, that is, exerts a force on uncharged objects made of certain materials, such as small pieces of paper. This force comes into play even when the bodies are not in contact. Let us do another activity with objects made of different materials. Activity 5.7: Let us experiment z Take two balloons, a length of thread, and a woollen cloth. z Inflate two balloons and hang them in such a way that they do not touch each other as shown in Fig. 5.9a. z Rub both balloons with the woollen cloth and release them. Be careful not to touch the rubbed balloons with your fingers. What do you observe? We observe that the balloons move away from each other as if they are repelling each other (Fig. 5.9b). z Now bring the woollen cloth used for rubbing the balloons close to one of the rubbed balloons. What happens? They move towards each other as if they are attracting each other. What do we infer from these observations? Fig. 5.8: Charged plastic scale attracting small paper pieces"}

Fig. 5.8: Charged plastic scale attracting small paper pieces Fig. 5.9: (a) Two uncharged balloons; (b) Two charged balloons repelling each other (a) (b) Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces 71 We found that the two similarly charged balloons repel each other whereas a charged balloon and the woollen cloth (with which the balloon was rubbed) attract each other. Does this indicate that the charge on the balloon is of a different kind from the charge on the woollen cloth? Since the balloons were charged in the same way, we can say that they have acquired similar charges. As the similarly charged balloons repelled each other, we can infer that similar (like) charges repel each other. Both the rubbing object and the rubbed object get charged but they acquire opposite kind of charges. Their attraction shows that opposite kind (unlike) of charges attract each other. The two kinds of static charges are said to be ‘positive’ and ‘negative’. The force exerted by a charged body on another charged body or an uncharged body is called electrostatic force. It is a non-contact force. Does it mean that there are two kinds of electrical charges? Gravitational force Activity 5.8: Let us observe z Take a ball and throw it vertically upwards. Does it come down? z Now throw it again, but this time harder. Does it still fall back down to the ground?

Think about different situations around you where any object thrown up in any direction, finally falls or comes back to the ground or floor. Fig. 5.10: Some objects falling towards the Earth A step further When the charges move, they constitute an electric current in an electrical circuit. It is the same current which makes a lamp glow or generates a heating effect or a magnetic effect. 72 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Since all the objects fall towards the Earth, it means the Earth attracts (pulls) them. The force with which the Earth attracts objects towards itself is called the gravitational force. The gravitational force exerted by the Earth is also called force of gravity or simply gravity. Since the gravitational force acts without contact with the object it attracts, it is a non-contact force. Gravitational force is always an attractive force, unlike magnetic force or electrostatic force, which can either be attractive or repulsive. You might have noticed that when an object is dropped from a height, it takes a straight vertical path downwards before touching the ground (Fig. 5.11a). When an object is thrown vertically upwards, the object moves up straight, slows down, stops momentarily at the top, and then takes a straight vertical path downwards (Fig. 5.11b). While going up, the speed of the object goes on decreasing till the object comes to a stop, its direction of motion changes and while coming down the speed goes on increasing. We say that the object undergoes a vertical motion when it moves in a vertical direction under the influence of the gravitational force. 5.5 Weight and Its Measurement The force with which the"}

The weight measures how strongly an object is pulled by the Earth. Since the weight is a force, it is measured in the same unit as that of force. Therefore, SI unit of weight is also newton (N). Is there any force which acts on them? What exerts this force? Why do all the objects fall towards the Earth? Does the Earth pull every object with equal force? (a) (b) Fig. 5.11: (a) Dropping an object from a height; (b) Throwing an object vertically upwards Chapter 5 — Exploring Forces 73 Let us now try to find out if the Earth pulls every object with equal force.

Is the stretch caused by each object the same? When an object is hung from a spring, the spring stretches due to the force applied on the object by the Earth.

We find that the stretch caused in the spring is different for different objects. This indicates that the Earth pulls different objects with different forces, that is, the weight of different objects is different. Can we use the spring to measure the weight of an object? A step further A spring balance is a simple device used to measure weight (force). It consists of a spring fixed at one end, with a hook attached at the other end. When we hang an object from the hook, the spring stretches, and the amount of stretching gives the weight of the object. There is a scale on the balance which is marked to show the weight (force) in newton. Usually, there is also another scale to show the corresponding values of mass in gram (g). These values have been marked with the assumption that the spring balance is used on the Earth, with the Earth’s gravitational force attracting the object. (b) Fig. 5.12: (a) A hanging spring; (b) Two different objects hung from the spring (a) Let us learn to measure the weight using a spring balance. But first, let us familiarise ourselves with a spring balance the way we did with thermometer earlier (in the chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’ in Curiosity, Grade 6). Activity 5.10: Let us observe z Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 carefully. What is the maximum weight it can measure? The maximum weight it can measure is 10 N.

Activity 5.11: Let us calculate z Look at the spring balance shown in Fig. 5.13 and note down the following: { How much is the weight difference indicated between the two bigger marks? The weight difference indicated between 0 and 01 N or between 01 N and 02 N is 1 N. { How many divisions (shown by smaller marks) are there between these two bigger marks? There are 5 divisions between these marks. { How much weight does one small division indicate? Fig. 5.14: Object suspended from a spring balance One small division can read 1 N 5 = 0.2 N. So, the smallest value that the spring balance can read is 0.2 N. Now using this method, calculate the smallest value of weight that can be measured with the spring balance given to you. Your school laboratory may have spring balances for which the range and the value of the smallest division may be different. It is, therefore, always necessary to look carefully at the spring balance (or any other instrument) you are about to use. Let us now learn how to measure weight using a spring balance. Activity 5.12: Let us measure z Take a spring balance and a few objects.

A step further The mass of an object can be measured indirectly by measuring its weight (using a spring balance) or by comparing its weight with the weight of an object of a known mass (using a beam balance). Since the weight of an object remains almost the same everywhere on the Earth, so for all practical purposes it is acceptable to weigh an object to find its mass. As we have learnt earlier (in the chapter ‘Materials Around Us’ in Curiosity, Grade 6), mass is the amount of matter in an object and is measured in grams (g) or kilograms (kg). Its value remains the same at every place. Weight, on the other hand, is the gravitational force with which the Earth (or another planet) pulls an object. Since gravitational force can vary very slightly from place to place on the Earth (and can be very different on different planets), weight can change, but mass does not.

Planet Earth Moon Mars Venus Jupiter Mass of the object 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg 1 kg Weight of the object 10 N 1.6 N 3.8 N 9 N 25.4 N A step further In everyday life, particularly for the goods we commonly use, we are more interested in the amount of matter in an object (its mass), rather than the force applied by the Earth upon it (its weight). However, though while the units of mass are used, instead of the term mass, the term weight is typically used. For example, it is said that the weight of the wheat bag is 10 kg. But in scientific use, this is not correct and it is important to use the correct terms with their correct units, even if every day language is more casual. 76 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Activity 5.13: Let us investigate z Take an empty plastic bottle (with its lid closed tightly) and a bucket full of water. z Push the bottle in the water (Fig. 5.15).

You would have felt an upward push and the bottle bounces back to the surface of the water. This indicates that water applies a force on the bottle in the upward direction. In fact, all liquids apply a similar force. The force applied by a liquid on an object in the upward direction is known as upthrust or buoyant force. When an object is placed in a liquid, the gravitational force due to the Earth acts on it downwards. But a buoyant force is applied on it by the liquid in the upward direction. If the gravitational force is more than the buoyant force, the object sinks, but if the two forces are equal, the object floats. One of the factors on which the buoyant force depends upon, is the density of the liquid. You will learn about density in a later chapter of this book. Fig. 5.15: Plastic bottle in water A step further Archimedes, a famous Greek scientist, discovered that when an object is fully or partially immersed in a liquid, it experiences an upward force which is equal to the weight of the liquid it displaces. This is known as Archimedes’ Principle. If the weight of a liquid displaced by an object is smaller than the weight of the object, the object will sink in the liquid. If the weight of the liquid displaced is equal to the weight of the object, the object will float in the liquid. 5.6 Floating and Sinking While taking out water from a bucket filled with water using a mug, do you notice that the mug feels lighter when it is inside water?

One such rock is Pumice, which is formed during volcanic eruptions. When lava with lots of gas and water vapour cools quickly, it traps tiny bubbles of gas inside. This creates a light, porous rock — filled with air pockets which is less dense than water and floats on it.

Does the wind exert force on fallen leaves to make them rise or on trees to bend? Recall other similar effects of the force exerted by wind like slamming of doors or rattling of windows, or fluttering of clothes? How does the force exerted by wind make this happen? The force exerted by wind creates wind pressure which causes these effects. In this chapter, we will explore the relationship between force and pressure, and understand how they shape powerful natural events like thunderstorms and cyclones. 6.1 Pressure Megha and her brother Pawan are going on a picnic. They walk to the picnic spot, carrying identical items in their bags (Fig. 6.1). On the way, Pawan keeps adjusting his bag, and looks uncomfortable. Megha asks, “Is there a problem with your bag?” Pawan responds, “Yes, it is hurting my shoulders.” Megha says, “Both our bags are equally heavy. Why does your bag hurt, and mine doesn’t?” Pawan reflects for a minute and says, “Perhaps, it is because of the difference in the straps of our bags. My bag has narrow straps while your bag has broad straps.” Can the shape or size of the straps really make a difference? Let us try to find out. When we carry a bag, we feel its weight because of the force of gravity acting on our shoulders. The weight of the bag with narrow straps acts on a smaller area of our shoulders, whereas the weight of the bag with broad straps is spread out over a larger area of our shoulders. It is due to this reason that we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broader straps than one with narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight."}

It is due to this reason that we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broader straps than one with narrow straps, although both bags have the same weight. Since the area over which the force acts is involved, we define a quantity called pressure, which is the force per unit area. So, Pressure = Force Area At this stage, we will consider only those forces which act perpendicular to the surface on which the pressure is to be computed. Fig. 6.1: Megha and Pawan carrying their bags 82 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Broad straps reduce the pressure exerted by the bag on our shoulders as compared to narrow straps. Therefore, we feel more comfortable carrying a bag with broad straps. Can you now understand why it feels easier to lift a water-filled bucket with a broad handle than with a narrow handle (Fig. 6.2)? Similarly, we have seen that when people carry loads like pots or vegetable baskets on their heads, they often place a round piece of cloth under the loads (Fig. 6.3). In both cases, the objective is to reduce pressure by increasing the area over which the weight acts. Pressure is defined as the force per unit area. The SI unit of force is newton and that of area is metre2. Therefore, the SI unit of pressure is newton/metre2 (N/m2). This unit is also called a pascal, denoted by Pa.

We conclude that when the area over which a force applied is smaller, the resulting pressure is higher, making it easier to do certain tasks. This is why it is easier to drive a nail using its pointed end, and it is easier to cut an apple with the sharp edge of a knife.

Attach them to one end of each pipe. z Clamp the pipes on a stand as shown in Fig. 6.5. z Now, fill both the pipes with water up to the same level about halfway. z Observe what happens to the balloons. z Do both balloons bulge? Do they bulge to the same extent? What can you infer from this activity? You must have observed that the two balloons bulge to the same extent. Why is it so? Notice that because of the different diameters, the weight of water in the two pipes is different. However, the bulge in both the balloons is the same. This means that the weight of water in the pipes could not be responsible for the extent of the bulge of the balloons. Could it be that the water column is exerting pressure? Yes, it is the pressure exerted by the water column which is responsible for the bulge. That is why equal water column heights produce equal bulges in the balloons, despite their different diameters.

Do you see any relation between the amount of bulge of the rubber balloon and the height of the water column in the pipe? You must have observed that the bulge of the balloon increases as the height of the water column increases. Thus, as the height of the water column in the pipe increases, the pressure at the bottom of the pipe also increases, which causes the balloon to bulge more. So, we can say that the pressure exerted by a liquid in a vessel depends on the height of its column. This is the reason why overhead tanks are placed at a height so that the pressure in the taps is increased, resulting in a good stream of water from the taps. Suppose you are living on the second floor of a three-storeyed building and an overhead water tank is placed on the top floor. Will you or your friend on the first floor receive a more powerful stream of tap water?

Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 85 You observe water flowing out through the holes on the sides of the bottle. What can you infer from this observation? It indicates that water also exerts pressure on the sides of a container. Therefore, we can conclude that liquids exert pressure not only at the bottom of the container, but also on its sides. In fact liquids exert pressure in all directions. You must have seen water spurting out like a fountain from leaking joints or holes in water pipes. Can you explain why this happens?

Do you know that the base of a dam is much broader than the top? This is because a broad base not only supports the structure of the dam, but also withstands the horizontal water pressure near the bottom (Fig. 6.8). The water stored in the dam, exerts pressure horizontally on the side walls of the dam and vertically on the floor due to the height of the water level. The pressure which acts horizontally, is very large near its bottom. Thus, to withstand the pressure, the base of the dam is made broader. Fig. 6.8: Dam Let us now try to understand if air also exerts pressure. 6.2 Pressure Exerted by Air You already know that air is all around us. The envelope of air surrounding the Earth is called atmosphere. The atmospheric air contains nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases in small quantities. The atmosphere extends up to many kilometres above the surface of the Earth. Let us find out if the atmosphere exerts pressure by performing the following activity. Activity 6.3: Let us explore z Take a paper plate, invert it and attach a stick to it as shown in Fig. 6.9a.

Make a hole at the centre of this chart paper for the stick to pass through. Cover the paper plate with the unfolded chart paper as shown in Fig. 6.9 c. z \u0007Lift the paper plate again and feel the effort needed in doing so. z In which case is the lifting easier, with the folded or the unfolded chart paper covering the paper plate? You would have observed that more effort is needed to lift the paper plate when it is covered with the unfolded chart paper, than with the folded chart paper. When we cover the paper plate with unfolded chart paper, the area of the covering sheet increases. The effort needed to lift the paper plate increases. Notice that the weight of the covering sheet has not changed. What can you infer from this? We can infer from these observations that air exerts force on the covering sheet, which makes it difficult to lift the paper plate. Moreover, this force increases with Fig. 6.10: A girl blowing a balloon Fig. 6.9: (c) Inverted paper plate with unfolded chart paper Fig. 6.9: (b) Inverted paper plate with two folds of chart paper increase in the area of covering sheets.

It means that the air is exerting a force on the paper plate, which increases as the area of the sheet covering it increases. As force per unit area is pressure, we can conclude that air exerts pressure on the paper sheet. In fact, air exerts pressure on all objects. The pressure exerted by air around us is known as the atmospheric pressure. You must have experienced that when you blow air into a balloon, it gets inflated. Why? This is because the air being filled inside the balloon exerts pressure on the walls of the balloon (Fig 6.10). Can we say that air exerts pressure in all directions? Yes, that is why the balloon expands in all directions. What happens when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth? The air escapes from the balloon. Why does the air escape from the balloon? Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 87 Have you ever wondered how large the atmospheric pressure is? Let us get an idea about its magnitude by performing the following activity. Activity 6.4: Let us perform z Take a good-quality rubber sucker.

{"id": "Ncert_class8_m+s_84750", "source": "Ncert_class8_m+s", "text": "to the surface? z Now, try to pull it off. Do you find it difficult to pull it off? When we press the sucker, most of the air between its cup and the surface on which it is placed is pushed out and the air pressure inside it is reduced. The sucker sticks to the surface because the pressure of air surrounding the sucker is higher than the pressure exerted by the air inside the sucker. To pull the sucker off the surface, the applied force should be strong enough to overcome the pressure difference between outside the sucker and inside the sucker. Do you know how large the atmospheric pressure is? The force exerted by the atmospheric air column over an area 15 cm × 15 cm is nearly equal to the force of gravity on an object of mass 225 kg (2250 N). The reason we are not crushed under this weight is that the pressure inside our bodies is also equal to the atmospheric pressure. This balances the pressure exerted from outside. The pressure inside our body is caused by the movement of fluids and gases in tissues and organs of the body. 6.3 Formation of Wind You must have noticed that on some days, the wind blows strongly, whereas on other days, it is calm. Sometimes, wind becomes so strong that it causes damage to life and property. You must have seen that when an inflated balloon is kept without closing its mouth, the air from the balloon escapes. Recall that when there is a puncture in the bicycle tube, the air escapes and the tube collapses. In both of these cases, does air move from a high pressure region to a low pressure region? The SI unit of pressure is N/m2, also known as pascal"}

However, the practical unit of air pressure is millibar (mb), which is equal to 100 Pa. Air pressure is also expressed in hectopascal (hPa), which is equal to 100 Pa.

Activity 6.5: Let us observe z Take two similar balloons made of thin rubber, and a drinking straw. z Insert one end of the straw into one balloon and secure it with a rubber band or thread. z Now inflate the second balloon and hold its mouth with your fingers, so that air does not escape. z Insert the free end of the straw into the neck of the inflated balloon and secure it with a rubber band or thread. Make sure that the air does not leak from the balloon as the straw is inserted in it. Now you have one end of the straw inside the inflated balloon and the other end inside the uninflated balloon as shown in Fig. 6.12. z Predict what would happen to the balloons. z Observe what happens to both the balloons. Did it happen as predicted? z Do you observe any change in the size of the balloons?

Write down your observations. .................................................................................................................... What can be the reason for the change in the sizes of the balloons? The air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher than that in the uninflated balloon. As a result, some air moves from the inflated balloon to the uninflated balloon, resulting in changes in the size of both the balloons. Do you notice that after some time both the balloons attain almost the same size and the flow of air stops? Why does the air flow stop? The flow of air continues till the air pressure in the inflated balloon is higher than the air pressure in the uninflated balloon. The air flow stops when the pressure in both balloons becomes equal. At this stage, both balloons are almost of the same size. Thus, we can conclude that air moves from a region of high air pressure to a region of low air pressure. You can relate this conclusion to the directions of the sea breeze and land breeze, which you studied in Curiosity, Grade 7. As land gets heated faster than water during the day, the air above the land How do winds form? Does the difference in air pressure have anything to do with the formation of winds? Fig. 6.12: Air moves from a high pressure region to a low pressure region Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 89 becomes warmer and lighter. Hence, it rises, creating an area of low pressure. The air from the high pressure region of the sea blows to the low pressure region which develops on the land, resulting in a sea breeze.

Therefore, a low pressure area develops above the sea. As a result, wind blows from the land to the sea, giving rise to land breeze. Thus, the phenomenon of land breeze and sea breeze is mainly due to the pressure differences over the land and the sea. If we could measure the speed of the escaping air in Activity 6.5, we would find that the speed of the air is higher if the pressure difference is higher. I have read that high-speed winds can blow off roofs.

Note down your observations. z Now blow harder and observe. When you blow between the two balloons, you observe that they move towards each other. This happens because when you blow air between the balloons, a low pressure area is created between them. The higher air pressure surrounding the balloon pushes them towards each other. You must have observed that blowing harder increases the speed at which the balloons approach each other. What can you infer from this activity? We infer that high speed winds are accompanied by a reduced air pressure. Fig. 6.13: Blowing between two balloons 90 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade"}

Fig. 6.13: Blowing between two balloons 90 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 When high-speed winds blow over houses, a low-pressure area is created over them, as high-speed winds are accompanied by a reduced pressure. Therefore, the air pressure above the roofs of the houses is lower than the pressure below them. If the pressure difference is large and the roofs are weak, they may be blown away, as shown in Fig. 6.14 a. That is why it is safer to keep doors and windows of the houses open during storms with high-speed winds. When the same wind moves over the roofs, and through the houses, the pressure difference between inside of the houses and over the roofs is reduced to a large extent. This helps prevent the roofs from being blown off as shown in Fig. 6.14 b. You must have experienced that when high-speed winds blow during storms, they are sometimes accompanied by thunder and lightning. Let us learn more about them. 6.5 Storms, Thunderstorms, and Lightning Fig. 6.14: (b) Roof of a house intact Fig. 6.14: (a) Roof of a house blown away Have you heard the sound of thunder and seen lightning during the rainy season? Yes, the sound of thunder is so frightening! Usually there is heavy rainfall too. When land gets heated, the warm and moist air, being lighter, rises, thereby creating a low pressure area. Cooler air from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to take its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. This results in a continuous process of wind circulation. As"}

Cooler air from the surrounding high-pressure areas flows to take its place. This air, in turn, gets heated and rises. This results in a continuous process of wind circulation. As the rising air expands, it cools and moisture in it condenses to form water droplets, creating clouds. The water droplets merge to form heavier drops, which come down as rain, hail, or snow. The strong winds accompanied by rain is called a storm. In hot, humid, and tropical regions like India, storms are more frequent. Under certain conditions, warm air rises to great heights that the low temperature there converts water droplets into ice particles. Strong winds blowing upwards and downwards (Fig. 6.15) facilitate rubbing between water droplets Fig. 6.15: Strong winds going up and down Warm air Cool air Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 91 Fig. 6.17: Safe position during lightning and ice particles. You have learnt in the chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that when two objects are rubbed against each other, they get charged. In this case, strong winds blowing upwards and downwards and rubbing against each other cause static electric charges to develop within the clouds. The positively charged lighter ice particles move upwards and occupy the upper part of the clouds. The negatively charged heavier water droplets occupy the lower part of the clouds. Thus, a charge separation within the cloud takes place. Also, when the negatively charged lower part of the cloud moves closer to the ground, it causes the ground and nearby objects, such as trees or buildings, to become positively charged (Fig. 6.16).

Normally, air acts as an electrical insulator and does not let opposite charges meet. But when the build up of charges becomes very large, the insulating property of air breaks down. A sudden flow of charges takes place, producing a bright flash of light called lightning. Lightning can occur as opposite charges collide within a cloud, between clouds, or between clouds and the ground. Lightning rapidly heats up the air around it, causing the air to expand and produce a loud sound known as thunder. A storm accompanied by lightning and thunder is called a thunderstorm. A step further Isolated and localised thunderstorms can sometimes occur in various regions of India. These thunderstorms are known by various names such as Kalboishakhi in West Bengal, Bihar, and Jharkhand and Bordoisila in Assam. They occur before the arrival of the monsoon, thereby helping kharif crops to grow. In Kerala, Karnataka, and Tamil Nadu, they are known as mango showers as they support the ripening of mangoes. Local thunderstorms in Karnataka help in the growth of coffee plants. Lightning can be dangerous! It can ignite fires, damage buildings, and cause severe burns or death in humans and animals. We must take necessary precautions and protect ourselves from lightning. During lightning, stay away from tall objects, find a low-lying open area and crouch down, and minimise contact with the ground. Do not lie down flat. Avoid using an umbrella with a metallic rod.

A lightning conductor is a metallic rod installed along the walls of buildings during their construction. One end of the rod is pointed. This end is kept higher than the highest point of the building (Fig. 6.18). The other end of the rod is buried deep in the ground. The rod provides easy path for the transfer of electric charges into the ground. Lightning conductor Fig. 6.18: A lightning conductor 6.6 Cyclone Cyclones are large storms that form over warm ocean waters. As the ocean water gets heated, the warm and moist air above it rises. As the moist air rises, the water vapour condenses to form raindrops. We know that during evaporation, water takes up heat to change into vapour. When this water vapour condenses into raindrops, heat is released back into the atmosphere. This causes further warming of the ascending air leading it to rise even further, creating an even lower pressure. Air from the surrounding regions rushes in and it also starts rising. Earth’s rotation causes the moving air to spin (Fig. 6.19). This cycle is repeated, resulting in the creation of a very low-pressure area with high-speed winds revolving around it. This spinning system of clouds, winds, and rain is called a cyclone. In a cyclone, the region of lowest pressure is at the centre, known as the eye of the cyclone.

In a cyclone, the region of lowest pressure is at the centre, known as the eye of the cyclone. At the eye of the cyclone, the wind is calm, but the surrounding region experiences strong winds and heavy rainfall. As a cyclone moves from the ocean towards the land, it generates higher wind speeds compared to the wind speeds produced by regular thunderstorms. Once the cyclone reaches land, the source of moist air is cut off and it gradually loses its strength. Fig. 6.19: Winds blowing from high pressure areas to low pressure areas High pressure Low pressure 994 mb 996 mb 998 mb 1008 mb High pressure Fig. 6.20: A cyclone Eye of cyclone Chapter 6 — Pressure, Winds, Storms, and Cyclones 93 Even as a cyclone loses its strength while travelling over land, it leaves behind a trail of destruction that can take months or even years to repair. Cyclones can be extremely destructive. For example, the Amphan cyclone in 2020 had peak wind speeds of 270 km/h. Strong winds during a cyclone push ocean water towards the shore, creating a wall of water that can be as high as 3–12 metres. This surge of water can flood coastal areas and even areas far from the sea. The heavy rainfall which accompanies a cyclone may cause rivers to overflow and can also trigger landslides. Seawater that rushes inland can contaminate drinking water sources and damage farmland. The salt in seawater can make soil less fertile, affecting crops.

Roads may get blocked due to fallen trees and debris, making it difficult for help to reach the affected areas. Power outages can last for days, disrupting emergency services and daily life. How can we protect ourselves during cyclones? It is important to stay updated on weather reports and periodic alerts, and warnings issued by the India Meteorological Department (IMD). Thanks to the weather monitoring satellites, today we can track cyclones and predict their path, helping us reduce their impact on life and property. Several national and international organisations work together to monitor cyclone-related disasters. If you live in a cyclone-prone area, keep an emergency kit ready with essential items. During a cyclone, quickly move to a nearby designated cyclone shelter. Let us wrap up! Cool air rushes to occupy the low-pressure area. Warm air rises, creating a low-pressure area. Warm air rises, cools, and the water vapour condenses to form clouds. Bigger water drops in the clouds fall to the ground as rain, hail, or snow. Positive and negative charges are created in the clouds by strong winds blowing upwards and downwards. Under certain weather conditions, storms may develop into cyclones. When positive and negative charges meet, they cause lightning. Lightning may occur within a cloud, between clouds, or between a cloud and the ground. 94 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Keep the curiosity alive 1. Choose the correct statement.

Probe and ponder Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter 99 You might have collected pebbles and stones from the sand while playing on a riverbank or a beach. Where do these pebbles, stones, and sand come from? In the mountains, rocks gradually break down due to erosion. Rivers flowing through these regions carry along the eroded rock pieces. As the rivers flow, they continue to break down the rocks further into pebbles, stones, sand; and transport large quantities of them to the plains. The bigger rocks are eventually broken down into finer grains of sand and clay. Is this grain the smallest unit of a bigger rock or can these grains of sand and clay be broken down further?

Recall Curiosity, Grade 7 chapter ‘Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical’— is grinding chalk a physical change or a chemical change?

Just like chalk, the grains of sand and clay are not the smallest units of bigger rocks. These are also made up of a large number of their constituent particles. Let us explore further! Recall the dissolution of sugar into water to form a solution. What happens to sugar when it is dissolved in water? Activity 7.2: Let us perform z Fill a glass tumbler with drinking water. z Put two teaspoons of sugar into it. z Do not stir the water. Taste a small spoonful of water from the top layer of the glass. Does the water taste sweet? z Now, stir the water until the sugar dissolves completely (Fig. 7.2). z Again taste a spoonful of water from the top layer. What difference in taste do you notice? Does it taste sweet? Since the top layer of water tastes sweet after dissolving sugar, it must be present in the solution. Do you observe any sugar particles in the solution? Sugar particles can no longer be observed but their presence can be sensed by taste. When sugar dissolves in water, it breaks up into its constituent particles which cannot be broken down further. Each tiny grain of sugar is made up of millions and millions of such constituent particles. Are the units of chalk obtained in this manner considered the smallest units of chalk?

Fig. 7.2: Dissolving sugar in water Safety first Perform the activity under the supervision of a teacher or an adult. Never eat or drink anything unless asked to. Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter 101 Activities 7.1 and 7.2 support the idea that matter is composed of a large number of extremely small particles. These particles are so small that they cannot be seen even through an ordinary microscope. But, where did the sugar go? The tiny sugar particles separate and occupy the available spaces between the water particles. These spaces between the particles are known as interparticle spaces. Chalk and sugar can both be broken down into their constituent particles. But how are the constituent particles held together to form the solid pieces we see? 7.2 What Decides Different States of Matter? The constituent particles of matter are held together through forces which are attractive in nature. These forces are called interparticle attractions. The strength of these attractions depends on the nature of the substance and the interparticle distance. Even a slight increase in the distance decreases the interparticle forces drastically. The strength of these forces ultimately decides the physical state of the substances. Do you know that since ancient times, people have been thinking about how far things could be broken down and what is matter made up of? Acharya Kanad, an ancient Indian philosopher, first spoke about the idea of a Parmanu (atom). He believed that matter is made up of tiny, indivisible eternal particles called Parmanu.

Our scientific heritage 102 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Let us explore how these attractions vary in different states. 7.2.1 Solid state How are constituent particles held together in solids? Activity 7.3 : Let us find out z Collect a few solid objects, such as a piece of iron or an iron nail, a piece of rock salt, a stone, a piece of wood, a key, and a piece of aluminium (Fig. 7.3). z Observe their shapes and sizes. z Try hammering them. z In which of the above six objects do you think particles are strongly held together? You must have noticed that all these objects are solids. They have a definite shape and volume. This is due to the fact that in solids, the particles are tightly packed and the interparticle attractions are very strong. These strong forces of attraction hold the particles in fixed positions, preventing them from moving freely (Fig. 7.4a). The particles can only move to and fro about their positions (vibrate or oscillate) but cannot move past each other. When solids are heated, their particles vibrate more vigorously (Fig. 7.4b). A stage is reached when these vibrations become so vigorous that the particles start leaving their position. The interparticle forces of attraction get weakened and the solid gets converted into the liquid state (Fig. 7.4c). The temperature at which this happens is the melting point of the solid.

Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter 103 The minimum temperature at which a solid melts to become a liquid at the atmospheric pressure is called its melting point. Generally, in a liquid state, particles are somewhat farther away from each other as compared to those in the solid state (ice is an exception—its particles are farther apart than those in water). Some solids have weak interparticle forces of attraction, so their melting points are low. While others have strong attractive forces and have high melting points. Some examples of solids and their melting points are shown in Table 7.1. S.No. Material Melting point 1. Ice 0 °C 2. Urea 133 °C 3.

You will notice that the water takes the shape of the container into which it is poured. So, we can say that the liquids do not have a fixed shape and take the shape of the container they are kept in. This happens because the particles of liquids are free to move. In all three containers, the water level remains at 200 mL and no change in volume is observed. Hence, we can say that liquids have a definite volume. However, if a container is not clean, some water may stick to its walls, causing the water level in the next container to be slightly less than 200 mL after pouring. Activity 7.4 shows that the particles of liquids can move freely, but only within a limited space. Therefore, we can infer that liquids have no fixed shape but have a fixed volume. Let us now compare interparticle forces of attraction in liquids and solids. Take some water in a shallow vessel and try to move your finger through it (Fig. 7.6). Are you able to move your finger through the water?

Fig. 7.6: Moving finger through water Chapter 7 — Particulate Nature of Matter 105 You can move your finger through water without breaking or cutting it permanently, which cannot be done in the case of solids. When you try this, you are temporarily displacing water. As soon as you remove your finger, the position of the water is restored. We can say that in liquids, the interparticle attractions are slightly weaker than in solids, but still strong enough to keep the particles close together. Recall Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Temperature and Its Measurement’, where you observed the temperature of boiling water (liquid). When a liquid is heated, a stage comes when it starts boiling. The temperature at which a liquid boils and turns into vapour at atmospheric pressure is called its boiling point. The movement of particles becomes so vigorous that they move apart from each other, resulting in a decrease in the interparticle forces of attraction. Eventually, the constituent particles can escape from the liquid state. The liquid is converted into vapour or the gaseous state. At the boiling point, the formation of vapour is very fast and occurs not only at the surface but also within the liquid. This process is observed as bubble formation in the liquid. However, vapour formation occurs at all temperatures, even below the boiling point, though slowly and only at the surface. This slower process is known as evaporation — about which you have learnt in earlier grades. 7.2.3 Gaseous state Do gases also have a fixed volume?

Like liquids, they also acquire the shape of the vessel they are in. This illustrates that the particles in gases move freely in all directions and the interparticle attractions are negligible. As a result, gases do not have a fixed shape or volume. In this activity, smoke is used to represent the gaseous state.

Fig. 7.9: The syringe piston in different positions (a) Pulling the plunger outwards (b) Placing thumb over the open end (c) Pushing the plunger inwards Syringe without a needle z What do you observe? As you do this, you will notice that the volume of air inside the syringe decreases. What can we say about the behaviour of gas in the syringe? When you compress the air by pushing the plunger, the particles are forced to come closer. This shows that the gas particles have a lot of space between them in their natural state, and this space can be reduced by applying external pressure. If you stop pushing the plunger, the gas particles spread, and the plunger moves back to its original position. Repeat this activity using water and observe. You would observe that water is practically incompressible. Let us perform another activity to learn about the interparticle spaces in liquids. 108 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Activity 7.7: Let us observe z Take a glass vessel, fill it about half with water, and mark the level of water A (Fig. 7.10a). z Add two teaspoons of sugar into it. z Mark the new water level on the glass vessel B (Fig. 7.10b). z Stir the water with a glass rod to dissolve the sugar (Fig. 7.10c). z Predict whether the water level will increase or decrease with respect to the mark B. z Mark this water level again as C (Fig."}

You will observe that initially, when sugar is added, the level of water increases, but after dissolution, it may decrease to some extent. Since the volume of the solution is less than the sum of the volumes of water and sugar, it indicates that there is some space between the water particles. The particles of the dissolved substance occupy these spaces (Fig. 7.11). Repeat the Activity 7.7 with some other soluble solids, such as common salt or glucose, and insoluble solids, like sand and stone pieces. What do you observe in each case? Do the sand particles dissolve? Does the volume of water in the vessel change after mixing, and why? Sugar and sand are both solids. Why does sugar dissolve in water but sand does not?

You learnt earlier that the constituent particles in solids are held together by strong forces of attraction. So, these particles do not move from one place to another and are closely packed. However, despite close packing, some space is left between the particles as shown in Fig. 7.12a. You might assume that the space between particles is filled with air, but this is not the case. They contain nothing at all. Fig. 7.12 summarises the packing of particles and the interparticle spacing in the three states of matter. A step further Often, we use the term ‘particle’ in different contexts. The meaning of this term changes with the context. For example, while talking about air pollution, the term Suspended Particulate Matter (SPM) is used. This term refers to the tiny dust particles suspended in air and not the constituent particles of matter which are extremely small as compared to the dust particles. In fact, even these tiny dust particles are also made up of a very large number of constituent particles, i.e, atoms and molecules. 7.4 \u0007How Particles Move in Different States of Matter?

This happens because the water particles are in constant motion. First they pull out the particles of potassium permanganate from its grain, and later they hit these particles so that they get spread throughout the liquid. In the case of many substances, the constituent particles are held together strongly that the water particles are unable to pull these out. Such substances, like sand, are insoluble in water. Think like a scientist Try it yourself!  Take three clean glass tumblers.  Pour hot water in one of them, water at room temperature in the second and ice-cold water in the third.  Drop a small grain of potassium permanganate into each of them.  Watch carefully and compare. What do you observe? Water particles move faster in hot water compared to water at room temperature, and even slower in ice-cold water. As a result, the potassium permanganate spreads the fastest in hot water, less quickly in water at room temperature, and the slowest in ice-cold water. Hence, the movement of particles increases when heat is provided. Try to depict it by drawing a diagram. How can we demonstrate the movement of gas particles that cannot be seen with the"}

Shortly, you can smell the fragrance throughout the room. This happens because the particles of the fragrance spread, filling the entire room. This shows that the particles of air are moving constantly. The air particles hit the particles of the fragrance and help them spread throughout the room. Oh! Now I know why and how the fragrance of perfume reaches us. Can you share a few other real-life situations where you have experienced the movement of gas particles? Ever heard of ... The particulate nature of matter plays a crucial role in many everyday processes. For example, when we wash clothes stained with oil using soap, numerous soap particles surround the oil particles on the fabric. One end of the soap particle attaches to the oil, and the other mixes with water, thus helping lift the oil off and wash it away (Fig. 7.15). Fig. 7.15: Particles of soap help in cleaning 112"}

Fig. 7.15: Particles of soap help in cleaning 112 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Based on our learnings from the chapter, we can say that matter is made up of small particles which are held together by the force of attraction. The strength of attractive forces between particles depends on the distance between them, which in turn depends on their thermal (heat) energy. Thus, it is the thermal energy of the particles that determines the physical state of matter. In the solid state, the thermal energy of particles is low, so they remain close to each other and experience strong interparticle attractive forces. This restricts their motion to only small vibrations. At the melting point, the thermal energy is used to overcome the attractive forces between particles, allowing the solid to change into a liquid. At this stage, the particles can move away from their fixed positions. The interparticle distance increases slightly, reducing the strength of the attractive forces to a level that allows the particles to move around, though still within a limited space. In the gaseous state, the particles have enough energy to overcome the forces of attraction between them and move freely in all directions. You will learn more about these particles that constitute matter in higher grades. Let us wrap up!

You have also learnt that all these things are made up of tiny particles. Most of the things around us are not made of just one substance; rather they are made up of two or more substances mixed together. Let us now understand how different substances come together to form mixtures. 8.1 What Are Mixtures? Have you ever wondered what makes your poha (Fig. 8.1) so delicious or how to make the perfect sprout salad? While these dishes may seem very different, they share something in common—they are both made by mixing several ingredients. We observe the mixing of substances in everyday life. Sugar dissolved in water is also a mixture, and so are soups and lemonade. When two or more substances are mixed, where each substance retains its properties, it is called a mixture. The individual substances that make up a mixture are called its components. The components of a mixture do not react chemically with each other. In some mixtures, the components — like green gram, chickpeas, onion, and tomato in a sprout salad (Fig. 8.2), are easy to see. Such mixtures, where the different components are generally visible with the naked eye or with a magnifying device, are non-uniform in nature. Can you identify a few more examples of non-uniform mixtures around you? On the other hand, some mixtures have components that cannot be seen separately even with the help of a microscope. For example, sugar and water particles cannot be seen separately in their mixture. Such types of mixtures, where the components are evenly distributed and cannot be distinguished, are uniform in nature (Fig. 8.3)."}

Ancient Indian texts, such as the Charaka Samhita, Susruta Samhita, Rasaratna Samucchaya, Rasa Jala Nidhi, etc., mention the use of alloys for medicinal purposes. For example, Bronze, also known as Kamsya, is an alloy made up of Copper (Tamra, 4 parts) and Tin (Vanga, 1 part), was used to improve digestion and boost immunity. Our scientific heritage 8.1.1 Is air a mixture? In Curiosity, Grade 6, you learnt about air and its composition in the chapter ‘Nature’s Treasures’. Is air a mixture? What kind of mixture is it? You have learnt that air is a uniform mixture of mainly nitrogen, oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and water vapour. Out of these, oxygen is required by most of the living beings to stay alive. It also helps in combustion. Nitrogen, which constitutes about 78% of the air, does not take part in combustion. We also learnt that air has water vapour in it. When warm air touches a cool surface, the water vapour turns into liquid water, forming tiny droplets. Recall the experiment where you tested the presence of carbon dioxide in the air that we exhale. Let us confirm the presence of carbon dioxide in the air. Activity 8.1:"}

Safety first Perform this step carefully. A step further Do you know that stainless steel is also a mixture? Stainless steel contains iron, nickel, chromium, and a small amount of carbon. They are mixed so uniformly that the entire mixture appears the same throughout and one cannot see the individual substances. Such mixtures are known as alloys. Brass, a mixture of copper and zinc, and bronze, a mixture of copper and tin, are some other examples of alloys (Fig. 8.4).

The components of a mixture may themselves be mixtures, as in poha and sprout salad, or pure substances like sugar or common salt dissolved in water. However, in science, all the components of a mixture must be pure substances only. Mixtures could be of several types depending on the physical state of their components.

However, in science, the purpose of separating a mixture is to obtain pure substances. 8.2 What Are Pure Substances? Have you ever noticed the word ‘pure’ written on the packs of some consumables, such as milk, ghee, and spices (Fig. 8.7)? The word ‘pure’ has slightly different meanings in common usage and in science. In common usage, ‘pure’ means unadulterated products. Adulteration is an illegal process of adding substances which are cheaper, or of a poor quality, to a product. This is usually done to increase the quantity or reduce the manufacturing cost. However, it deteriorates the quality of the product. It can also make the product hazardous to health. Fig. 8.7: Some consumable items Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures 121 In science, however, a pure substance is the one that has no other substance present in it. For a scientist, even these products that look pure can be considered impure if they are made of more than one substance. A pure substance is a kind of matter that cannot be separated into other kinds of matter by any physical process. When a scientist says that something is pure, it means that the substance consists of the same type of particles. A step further According to science, how would you classify milk, packed fruit juice, baking soda, sugar, and soil — as mixtures or pure substances? 8.3 What Are the Types of Pure Substances?

Water Hydrogen + Oxygen￼ 8.3.1 Elements The two substances hydrogen and oxygen formed in Activity 8.3, are pure substances and are termed as elements. Each element is made up of identical particles called atoms. These particles are different from the particles of any other element. Elements are substances that cannot be further broken down into simpler substances. They are the building blocks of all matter. Some other examples of elements are gold, silver, sulfur, carbon, etc. The atoms of most of the elements cannot exist independently. Two or more such atoms combine and form a stable particle of that element called a molecule. For example, two atoms of hydrogen combine to form one molecule of hydrogen. Similarly, two atoms of oxygen combine to form one molecule of oxygen (Fig. 8.10). A step further Elements can be classified into metals and non-metals. You have already studied that gold, silver, magnesium, iron, and aluminium are metals, whereas carbon, sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen are non-metals. Isn't it interesting to know that some elements like silicon and boron have intermediate properties between those of metals and non-metals? They are called metalloids, about which you will learn in higher grades.  The number of elements known at present is 118, and most of them exist in a solid state.  Eleven elements exist in a gaseous state at room temperature, all of which are non-metals like oxygen, helium,"}

A step further Ever heard of ... When electric current is passed through water, it breaks down into hydrogen and oxygen. Is this a chemical change or a physical change? Recall Curiosity, Grade 7, chapter ‘Changes Around Us: Physical and Chemical’. Fig. 8.10: Depiction of molecules of (a) hydrogen; (b) oxygen (a) (b) 124 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 8.3.2 Compounds Why cannot we separate hydrogen and oxygen present in water by physical means? In water, the particles of hydrogen and oxygen are so tightly attached to each other that it is generally impossible to separate them apart using physical methods. That is why water is a compound. Compounds are formed when different elements combine in fixed ratios to form something entirely new. The properties of compounds are different from those of elements forming that compound. The constituent elements of a compound cannot be separated by any physical method. From Activity 8.3, we find that molecules of water are made of two different elements: hydrogen and oxygen (Fig. 8.11), combined chemically in a fixed ratio. The ratio of the number of atoms of hydrogen to oxygen in water has been found to be 2:1. Are common salt and sugar elements or compounds? Let"}

Sodium, a soft metal, and chlorine, a hazardous gas, combine to form a harmless yet taste-enhancing substance that is essential for our lives. This substance is known as sodium chloride, which is made up of particles of sodium and chlorine in a 1:1 ratio. We learnt that dissolved sodium chloride (common salt) may be separated from water by the physical process of evaporation. Is it possible to separate sodium chloride into its elements by physical processes? Let us now explore if we can separate the elements in sugar! Activity 8.4: Let us experiment z Put a teaspoon of sugar in a boiling tube. z Heat it gently as shown in Fig. 8.12a. z What do you observe? Oh!

Was it in the dry sugar, or did it come by the condensation of water vapour in the air? Since we are heating the tube, the water must have come from the dry sugar and not from the air. Can you predict what is left behind? Charcoal (carbon) is left behind in the boiling tube. You can scoop it out in a watch glass (Fig. 8.12c) and explore if it burns like coal. Sugar decomposes on heating and gives carbon and water. As you know, water consists of hydrogen and oxygen. Hence, sugar cannot be an element. It may be stated that sugar is a chemical compound consisting of the elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen. Let us explore more about compounds.

Sample A: We can say that Sample A is a mixture of the two elements—iron and sulfur. Its components retain their properties, and their black and yellow coloured particles can be seen. On bringing magnet near Sample A, the iron filings get attracted towards the magnet. Hence, iron and sulfur can be separated. You might have observed that in Sample A, iron in the mixture reacts with dilute hydrochloric acid to form iron chloride and hydrogen gas. The gas is colourless, has no smell, and burns with a ‘pop’ sound.

Elements, compounds, and mixtures are all around us. The air we breathe is a mixture of gases like oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide. Water, which is essential for life, is a compound Chapter 8 — Nature of Matter: Elements, Compounds, and Mixtures 129 made of elements, hydrogen and oxygen. Elements like iron and aluminium are used to construct bridges, buildings, and vehicles. Understanding these concepts is not just about recognising what surrounds us; it is also the key to innovation. For instance, chemists study how elements combine to create compounds, enabling them to invent life-saving medicines and vaccines to fight diseases. This knowledge also helps in the creation of fertilisers thereby enhancing crop production that feeds the ever-increasing human population globally. Engineers and material scientists rely on their understanding of compounds and mixtures to design materials with unique properties. For example, they have developed alloys like stainless steel, which is stronger and more durable than pure iron. Wood, steel, and concrete, which are used as building materials, are all mixtures. You learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. Let us learn about these minerals. An example of a ‘wonder’ material developed by material scientists is graphene aerogel. This is made from carbon"}

You learnt that various metals are obtained from minerals. Let us learn about these minerals. An example of a ‘wonder’ material developed by material scientists is graphene aerogel. This is made from carbon and is said to be the lightest material on earth. It is so light that even grass can hold it (Fig. 8.21). It is highly porous and therefore, has a high absorbing capacity. For this reason, it can potentially be used as an environmental cleaner, for example, to clean up oil spills in both seas and on land. It is useful in fabricating energy-saving devices and special coatings for buildings. Fig. 8.21 A step further 8.5 What Are Minerals? Most rocks are a mixture of minerals, which can be viewed with the eyes, or by using a magnifying glass or a microscope. Some of the minerals are called native minerals, which are pure elements and not compounds. These can be metals, such as gold, silver, copper, etc., or non-metals like sulfur, carbon, etc. Most of the minerals are compounds made up of more than one element. Some common examples of minerals include quartz, calcite, mica, pyroxene, and olivine (Fig. 8.22). Many things that we use in our everyday life are made up of minerals or elements extracted from minerals. For example, cement is made from calcite, quartz, alumina, and iron oxide, which are minerals or are obtained from minerals. Talcum powder is made from the mineral talc.

Light, heat, electricity, and even thoughts and emotions are important parts of our world, but they are not made of matter. Understanding what matter is—and what it is not—helps us better understand the world around us. Use of elements, compounds, and mixtures in Indian Art The Dhokra art is an old craft from Bihar and Odisha that uses different metals to create beautiful figures inspired by nature (Fig. 8.23). The process begins with shaping a design in beeswax. This wax model is covered with clay to make a mould. After the clay hardens, the wax is melted out, leaving a hollow space. This space is then filled with molten brass or bronze which makes Dhokra art strong and gives it a shiny golden colour. The figures often show animals, people, and nature, reflecting tribal creativity and tradition. Our scientific heritage Fig. 8.23: Dhokra art Snapshots  A mixture consists two or more substances mixed together.

When salt and sugar are mixed with water, a uniform mixture is formed, whereas when chalk powder or sand, or sawdust is mixed with water, the components are not evenly distributed. Such mixtures are known as non-uniform mixtures (Fig. 9.2a and 9.2b). Let us explore the science of mixing things together. 9.1 What Are Solute, Solvent, and Solution? A uniform mixture, such as that of salt or sugar, and water, is called a solution. Whenever a solid is mixed with a liquid to form a solution, the solid component is called the solute, and the liquid component is called the solvent. The solute dissolves in the solvent to form a solution (Fig. 9.3). Solute + Solvent Solution When a solution is formed by mixing two liquids, it is not always clear which substance is dissolving the other. In such cases, the substance present in smaller amount is called the solute, while the one in larger amount is called the solvent. We know air is a mixture. Would a mixture of gases also be considered a solution? Just as water can act as a solvent in liquid solutions, gases can also form solution — with air being a common example. Air is a gaseous solution. Since nitrogen is present in the largest amount in the air, it is considered as the solvent, while oxygen, argon, carbon dioxide, and other gases are considered as solutes.

After adding a few more spoons of salt, a stage comes when the added salt does not dissolve completely and the undissolved salt settles at the bottom. This indicates that the water can no longer dissolve any more salt because it has reached its limit. The solution in which more solute can be dissolved at a given temperature, is called an unsaturated solution (Fig. 9.5). However, when the solute stops dissolving and begins to settle at the bottom, the solution is called a saturated solution at that particular temperature (Fig. 9.6). The amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution (or solvent) is termed as its concentration. Depending upon the amount of solute present in a fixed quantity of solution, it can be called a dilute solution (less amount of solute) or a concentrated solution (more amount of solute). Dilute and concentrated are relative terms. So, one can say in Activity 9.1, the solution obtained by dissolving one spoon of salt is dilute as compared to that obtained by dissolving two or more spoons of salt. Can you now reflect — which solution is more concentrated; 2 spoons of salt in 100 mL of water or 4 spoons of salt in 50 mL of water? From Activity 9.1, we can say that the maximum amount of solute that dissolves in a fixed quantity of the solvent is called its solubility. Does temperature affect the solubility of a solute?

It has been observed that the solubility of gases generally decreases as temperature increases. More oxygen can dissolve in cold water, ensuring sufficient oxygen for aquatic life (Fig. 9.8). On the other hand, when water warms up, the solubility of oxygen decreases. Now I understand that the mixtures we use can be of two types—uniform and non-uniform. Uniform mixtures are called solutions, and their components are not visible separately. In non-uniform mixtures, the components can be seen either with the naked eye or with a magnifying device. I observed that in some non-uniform mixtures, such as sawdust in water, the sawdust floats, whereas in the mixture of sand and water, the sand sinks. I wonder why that happens? Fig. 9.8: Aquatic species in water 140 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 9.4 Why Do Objects Float or Sink in Water? You must have observed that some objects float while others sink in water (Fig. 9.9). You may have noticed that, while washing rice, husk particles present in the rice float on the surface of water while rice sinks to the bottom of the container. Why does this happen? If you add oil to water, it floats on water. Generally, it is believed that objects that float in a liquid are lighter and others that sink are heavier than the liquid. A wooden stick and an iron rod may be of the same size, yet the iron rod feels much heavier.

When we say that iron is heavier than wood, we are referring to a special property known as density, which describes the heaviness of an object. Note However, the density of a substance is not the only factor that decides whether it will float or sink in a particular liquid. Let us explore further. 9.5 What Is Density? Imagine a crowded bus where many people are packed together — this is an example of high density whereas, the same bus with only a few people is an example of low density. Similarly, a forest where trees grow close to each other is called a dense forest (Fig. 9.10a), but if the trees are far apart (Fig. 9.10b), it is considered less dense. How do scientists define density? Let us find out. We have learnt that matter is anything that possesses mass and occupies space (volume). Density is defined as the mass present in a unit volume of that substance. The density of a substance may be expressed mathematically using the formula: Density = Mass Volume The density of a substance is independent of its shape or size. However, it is dependent on temperature and pressure. Pressure primarily affects the density of gases, while its effect on solids and liquids is negligible.

What does this tell us about the density of the oil, and is it less or more than that of water? The units in which density is expressed will depend upon the units of mass and volume taken. As you have learnt, the SI units of mass and volume are kilogram (kg) and cubic metre (m3), respectively. Therefore, the SI unit of density is kilogram per cubic metre, abbreviated as kg/m3. In case of liquids, other units of density are also used for convenience, such as gram per millilitre, abbreviated as g/mL and gram per cubic centimetre, abbreviated as g/cm3. Conversion factor for density 1 kg/m3 = 1000 g/m3 = 1000 g/1000 L = 1 g/L = 1 g/1000 mL = 1 g/1000 cm3 The mass of 1 mL of water is close to 1 g at room temperature. For the measurement of the mass of water, we generally consider the volume in mL and its mass in g. Hence, 10 mL of water would be approximately 10 g. Similarly, 100 mL of water would be approximately 100 g. Suppose the mass of an aluminium block is 27 g and its volume is 10 cm3, its density is 2.7 g/cm3. From this, it can be said that aluminium is 2.7 times denser than water. We express this fact by saying that the relative density of aluminium with respect to water is 2.7.

How to measure mass? You learnt the term ‘mass’ in Curiosity, Grade 6. Mass is the quantity of matter present in any object. The instrument used to measure the mass of an object is known as a balance. You must have seen various types of balances being used by shopkeepers. Here, we are using a digital weighing balance to measure the mass. You learnt in chapter ‘Exploring Forces’ that on Earth, weight and mass are closely related. 142 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 You may measure the mass by doing the following activity. Activity 9.3: Let us measure z Switch ON the digital weighing balance. z Observe the initial reading on the digital weighing balance display. z It should show a zero reading. If not, then we must bring it to zero by pressing the tare or reset button (Fig. 9.12a). z Place a dry and clean watch glass or butter paper on the pan. z Note the reading on the digital weighing balance. z Reset the digital weighing balance reading to zero by pressing the tare or reset button as shown in Fig. 9.12b. z Now, carefully place the solid object, such as stone, on the watch glass (Fig. 9.12c). z Note the reading displayed on the balance, which"}

A step further As mentioned in Chapter 5, the words ‘mass’ and ‘weight’ are often used interchangeably in everyday language. But they have different meanings in science, which can sometimes cause confusion. Mass is the quantity of matter present in an object or a substance. Its units are gram (g) and kilogram (kg). On the other hand, weight is the force by which the Earth attracts an object or a substance towards itself, and it is measured in newtons (N). Most balances (except two-pan balances like in Fig. 9.13) actually measure weight, but their scales are marked in mass units, so they show values in grams or kilograms (Fig. 9.12c).

A tetra pack says it contains 200 mL buttermilk (chach) (Fig. 9.14). What does that mean? You learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 that volume is the space occupied by an object. You also know that the SI unit of volume is cubic metres, written as m³. It is the volume of a cube whose each side is one metre in length. Volume of smaller objects is conveniently expressed in a decimetre cube (dm3) or centimetre cube (cm3). One centimetre cube is also written as one cc. Volume of liquids is expressed in litres (L) which is equivalent to 1 dm3. A commonly used submultiple of a litre is millilitre (mL) which is equivalent to 1 cm3. One of the common apparatuses used to measure the volume of liquids is a measuring cylinder. It is a narrow transparent cylindrical container with one side open and the other side closed as shown in Fig. 9.15. There are markings on the transparent body of the cylinder that indicate the volume of liquid in the measuring cylinder. We can use it to measure the desired amount of a liquid. Measuring cylinders are available in different sizes to measure volume — 5 mL, 10 mL, 25 mL, 50 mL, 100 mL, 250 mL, etc (Fig. 9.15). How accurately can these measuring cylinders measure?

Take a measuring cylinder and observe it carefully. Note down the following: z What is the maximum volume it can measure? Now look at the measuring cylinder (Fig. 9.16) carefully. The cylinder is marked as 100 mL; therefore, it can measure volume up to 100 mL. What is the smallest volume it can measure? Look at the measuring cylinder again. z How much is the volume difference indicated between the two bigger marks (for example, between 10 mL and 20 mL)? Fig. 9.14: A pack of buttermilk of 200 mL 144 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 z How many smaller divisions are there between the two bigger marks? z How much volume does one small division indicate? The smallest volume that the measuring cylinder can read is__________. For the measuring cylinder shown in Fig. 9.16, the volume difference indicated between 10 mL and 20 mL, or between 40 mL and 50 mL, is 10 mL. The number of divisions between these marks is 10. So, one small division can read 10 ÷ 10 = 1 mL. That is, the smallest value that this measuring cylinder can read is 1 mL. The smallest volume that a measuring cylinder can measure depends on the capacity of the measuring cylinder. Usually it is 0.1 mL in smaller measuring cylinders with a capacity of 10 mL or 25 mL, it is 1 mL in a 100 mL measuring cylinder, 2 mL in a 250 mL measuring cylinder, and 5 mL in a 500 mL measuring cylinder.

Suppose we want to take 70 mL of water. If we use a 50 mL measuring cylinder, it would not be possible to measure 70 mL of water in one step. First, we have to measure 50 mL water and then 20 mL. Measuring volume in more than one step is not convenient. On the other hand, if a 250 mL or 500 mL measuring cylinder is used, the measurement can be done in one step but the accuracy would be reduced as the smallest volume that these measuring cylinders can measure is greater than that of a 100 mL measuring cylinder. Hence, a 100 mL measuring cylinder is the best choice for this measurement.

Did you know that our planet, Earth, is composed of several layers, such as crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core, each with its particular range of density? The outermost layer, called the crust, is the lightest and the density of the different layers increases as we move towards the centre (Fig. 9.20). As one moves deeper into the Earth, both the pressure and the temperature rise significantly, making the materials heavier and more compact. Ever heard of ... In ancient times, before large ships were invented, people used bamboo and wooden logs to travel across rivers and seas (Fig. 9.21). Bamboo was used because it is light, hollow, and floats easily on water. People tied bamboo poles together to make rafts and small boats for fishing, trading, and crossing water bodies. Wooden logs, especially from strong trees were either hollowed out to make boats or used as rafts. These simple boats, made from locally available materials, were important for moving around and connecting different places. Even today, similar traditional boats made of bamboo or wood are used in some regions—not just for transport, but also as tourist attractions.

Fig. 9.21: Bamboo raft floats on water 9.5.2 Effect of temperature on density Generally, the density of a substance decreases with heating and increases with cooling. This can be explained on the basis of what you have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’. As temperature increases, the particles of a substance whether, solid, liquid, or gas, tend to move away and spread. This results in an increase in volume but there is no change in mass. Since the Density = Mass/Volume, upon heating, the volume increases and the density decreases. This explains why hot air moves up as it is less dense than the cool air around it. The hot air balloon works on the same principle (Fig. 9.22).

For gases, increasing pressure causes the particles to move closer together. As a result, the volume of the gas decreases and its density increases. In the case of liquids, pressure has a small effect because they are nearly incompressible. We have learnt in chapter ‘Particulate Nature of Matter’ that the particles in solids are very close to each other. So, how is the density of solids affected when pressure is applied? Solids are even less affected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density are usually negligible. Ever heard of ... Why does ice float on water? Ice floats on water because it is lighter"}

Solids are even less affected by pressure than liquids, and changes in their density are usually negligible. Ever heard of ... Why does ice float on water? Ice floats on water because it is lighter than liquid water (Fig. 9.23). Water has a special property that its density is highest at 4 °C. It means water is heaviest at 4 °C. As the temperature drops, and water turns into ice at 0 °C, it undergoes a change in structure—the particles arrange themselves in a way that takes up more space. This process is called expansion. Because the same amount of water now occupies a larger volume, its density decreases. As a result, ice becomes lighter than liquid water and floats on its surface. This is important for animals living in lakes and oceans because ice floats, it forms a layer on top, keeping the water underneath warm enough for fish and other creatures to survive, even in extremely cold weather.

In case of a convex mirror, the image is always erect and smaller than the object, that is diminished. However, the size of the image decreases slightly as the object is moved away from the convex mirror. This activity shows that spherical mirrors (concave and convex) behave differently from plane mirrors. A plane mirror always forms an erect image of the same size as the object.

In addition, in the case of a concave mirror, the image also gets inverted when the object is taken away from the mirror. Lateral inversion of the image is seen in all three types of mirrors. I just got an idea. We can also identify whether a mirror is plane, or concave, or convex by looking at the images of an object formed in them! Yes. But where do we find concave and convex mirrors being used in our surroundings? The reflectors of torches, headlights of cars and scooters are concave in shape (Fig. 10.6a). Have you ever noticed a dental mirror used by a dentist for inspecting teeth? It is a concave mirror which provides an enlarged view of teeth when held close to the teeth inside the mouth (Fig. 10.6b). A step further Do you remember learning about the use of telescope in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’ in Curiosity, Grade 6? Most modern telescopes are reflecting telescope that use curved mirrors, with the main mirror being a large concave mirror. Look at the side-view mirrors on vehicles. These mirrors are convex. They always form an erect image of the traffic behind and smaller than the actual vehicles. Also, since the convex mirror is Fig. 10.6: Use of concave mirror (a) As a reflector of a torch; (b) By a dentist (b) (a) Chapter 10 — Light: Mirrors and Lenses 157 curved outside, it provides a much wider area of the road behind.

Convex mirrors are also installed in big stores to monitor a large area to deter thefts. 10.3 What Are the Laws of Reflection? Let us now repeat an activity which we did earlier in grade 7, but this time we will extend it further. Do you remember doing the activity for observing the reflection of a beam of light from a plane mirror? Activity 10.4: Let us experiment We have observed images formed by three types of mirrors — plane, concave, and convex. But are there any laws which govern the image formation?

Place the plane mirror upright on it. z Using the thin slit and torch, obtain a thin beam of light along the paper and adjust it to fall upon the mirror as shown in Fig. 10.8a. z Now, move the slit and torch slightly so that the beam of light falls at a different angle on the mirror (Fig. 10.8b).

To understand this better, let us draw this on a paper, step by step. But before doing that, let us learn how to represent light. We often represent light by straight lines with arrows, or rays. Rays indicate the path along which light travels. Do you remember learning earlier that the light travels along a straight line? z Draw a line showing the position of the plane mirror. Also, draw lines with arrows (rays) indicating the beam of light falling on the mirror and the reflected beam of light as shown in Fig. 10.9a. The ray of light that falls on the mirror is called the incident ray. The ray of light that comes back from the mirror is called the reflected ray. z Now remove the mirror. From the point where the incident ray strikes the mirror, draw a line making an angle of 90° to the line representing the mirror. This line is known as the normal to the reflecting surface at the point of incidence, O (Fig. 10.9b). The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called the angle of incidence (i) (Fig. 10.9c). The angle between the normal and the reflected ray is known as"}

The angle between the normal and the incident ray is called the angle of incidence (i) (Fig. 10.9c).

What would be the angle of incidence and angle of reflection in this case? Both the angles would be zero in this case. S.No. Angle of incidence (i ) Angle of reflection (r ) Table 10.1: Measuring angles of incidence and reflection Do you notice that both angles in Table 10.1 are nearly equal?

Do you still see the reflected beam on the extended portion? z Flatten the paper again and observe. The reflected beam disappears when the sheet is bent but reappears when it is flattened again. This shows that the reflected beam lies in the same plane as that of the incident beam. Bending the sheet creates a new plane, breaking this alignment. The incident ray, the normal to the mirror at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray, all lie in the same plane. This is another law of reflection. A step further In the two cases, even though the directions of incident rays are different, they fall at the same point on the mirror, and thus, the directions of normal are the same. However, the direction of the reflected ray is such that the incident ray, the normal at the point of incidence, and the reflected ray all lie in the same plane in both cases.

Activity 10.6: Let us explore z Collect a plane mirror, a concave mirror, a convex mirror, stand for mirrors, a torch, a comb, and a paper clip to hold the comb upright. z Use the same setup as Activity 10.4 again, but instead of a single slit, leave many openings of the comb uncovered to obtain multiple parallel beams of light (Fig. 10.11a). z Let the multiple parallel beams of light fall upon the plane mirror, concave mirror, and convex mirror, one by one. Observe the reflected beams. Is your observation similar to what is shown in Fig. 10.11 (b), (c), and (d)? When multiple parallel beams of light fall upon a plane mirror, the multiple reflected beams are also parallel (Fig. 10.11b). However, when multiple beams of light fall upon a concave mirror, the multiple reflected beams get closer, that is, they converge (Fig. 10.11c). Whereas, in the case of a convex mirror, the multiple reflected beams spread, that is, they diverge (Fig. 10.11d). In the case of spherical mirrors, even though each ray of light follows the laws of reflection, the curved surface of spherical mirrors causes the parallel beam of rays to either converge (concave) or diverge (convex) on reflection depending on the shape of the mirror.

The letters under the water drop look different — they might appear larger than the letters nearby! The curved surface of the water drop made the size of the text look different.

As she looked up at the sky filled with colourful kites, she noticed the Moon shining during the daytime. She was surprised as she had always thought the Moon appeared only at night. Also, the Moon did not appear like a full circle, but that didn’t surprise her as much. She knew its shape changed every night. Still, it got her thinking. She remembered learning that the Moon is spherical and shines by reflecting sunlight. Then why isn’t the whole Moon visible every night? For a moment, she wondered if it was due to a lunar eclipse. But eclipses are rare and brief. So, what causes the Moon’s changing shape? 11.1 \u0007How Does the Moon’s Appearance Change and Why?

Did the Moon appear at the same position in the sky as on the previous day? 11.1.1 Phases of the Moon You may have observed that the bright portion of the Moon decreases from a full circle to a half circle in about a week, as shown in Fig. 11.2. The bright portion continues to shrink for another week until it is no longer visible. This two-week period is called the waning period of the Moon. Different names are given to the Moon’s visible shapes during this cycle (Fig. 11.2). The day when the Moon appears as a full bright circle is called the full Moon day (or Purnima), and the day when it is not visible is called the new Moon day (or Amavasya). After the new Moon, its bright side grows to a half circle in about a week and to a full circle (full Moon) in another week. The period when the bright part of the Moon increases is called the Fig. 11.2: Waxing (Shukla Paksha) and waning period (Krishna Paksha) of the Moon as viewed from the Earth Waxing Gibbous Crescent Crescent Waning Full Moon About 1 week About 1 week About 1 week About 1 week New Moon Gibbous Chapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies 173 waxing period.

The Moon goes through a waning period followed by a waxing period in a cyclical manner as shown in Fig. 11.2. The cycle from one full Moon to the next takes about a month. The changing shapes of the bright portion of the Moon from one day to another as seen from the Earth are called the phases of the Moon. 11.1.2 Locating the Moon When you checked the Moon at the same time on successive days (for example, at sunrise), did you see it in a different part of the sky? On a full Moon day, the Moon is nearly opposite the Sun — when the Sun rises in the East, the Moon is almost setting in the West. On subsequent mornings at sunrise, as its bright part continues to decrease, the Moon appears to move closer in the sky to the Sun. When the bright part of the Moon decreases to a half circle shape, the Moon is overhead at Sunrise. A few days later, the crescent Moon appears even closer to the Sun. Knowing the phase of the Moon and whether it is waxing or waning can thus help us find out where and when to look for the Moon on any given day. A waxing Moon is easiest to spot at sunset, and a waning Moon at sunrise. Because of these shifts, the Moon always rises and sets at different times than the Sun.

Look in a local newspaper or on the Positional Astronomy Centre (India Meteorological Department) website to find the moonrise time in your area. Check these times for several days in a row and you will see that the Moon rises about 50 minutes later each day. Sometimes moonrise happens in the afternoon (around 2:00 – 4:00 p.m.), so you can spot the Moon in the eastern sky during daylight. You may need to wait about 30 minutes past the listed moonrise time for the Moon to climb high enough for it to be seen.

You may recall learning earlier that the Moon does not emit light of its own, but shines because it reflects sunlight that falls on it. The half of the Moon that faces the Sun receives sunlight and becomes illuminated (Fig. 11.3). The other half facing away from the Sun does not receive sunlight and remains non-illuminated. The Moon revolves around the Earth and, only one half of the Moon always faces the Earth. However, the portion of the Moon facing the Earth is not always its illuminated part. We can only see the illuminated portion of the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times"}

We can only see the illuminated portion of the Moon from Earth. Sometimes, the entire illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth, and at other times only a part of it. At such times the illuminated portion of the Moon that we see is not a full circle. On New Moon day, we do not see the illuminated portion of the Moon at all, as only the non-illuminated portion of the Moon faces the Earth. Therefore, the Moon appears different on different days.

Fig. 11.5a shows the positions of the Moon corresponding to the different positions of the ball in Fig. 11.4b. Also shown are the Earth and the sunrays. As shown in Fig. 11.5a, the Moon revolves once around the Earth from position A to H and back to position A in about one month. The side of the Moon that faces the Sun is illuminated. 176 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The portion of the Moon that faces the Earth is marked by the orange dashed lines and arrows.

At positions D and F, less than half of the illuminated portion, called the crescent phase, can be seen. The change in the fraction of the illuminated portion of the Moon seen from Earth causes phases of the Moon. The phases that will be seen from the Earth at different positions of the Moon are shown in Fig. 11.5b.

This happens because, as shown in Fig. 11.6, the Moon moves ahead in its orbit while the Earth completes one rotation about its axis in 24 hours. Earth needs to rotate some more for the Moon to appear in nearly the same spot in the sky. A step further The Moon phases do not happen due to Earth’s shadow. It is an incorrect explanation for the Moon’s phases that Earth’s shadow falls on it. As we have learnt, the phases of the Moon occur due to the relative change in orientation of the Sun, Moon, and Earth as the Moon revolves around the Earth. The Earth’s shadow on the Moon causes a lunar eclipse, not the Moon’s phases as we learnt earlier (in chapter ‘Earth, Moon and the Sun’ in the Curiosity, Grade 7). Lunar eclipses can only happen on a full Moon day and solar eclipses can happen only on a new Moon day. But they do not occur every month because of the small tilt of the Moon’s orbit with respect to the Earth’s orbit around the Sun.

We have learnt earlier that when viewed from the Earth, the Sun appears to rise in the eastward direction, set in the westward direction every day, and rise again the next day. This apparent periodic motion of the Sun seen by us is primarily due to the rotation of the Earth around its own axis. This natural cycle of the Sun due to the rotation of the Earth, is the foundation of the day, a unit to measure time. The average time that the Sun takes to go from its highest position in the sky on one day to the highest position in the sky the next day, is 24 hours, and is called the mean solar day. The highest position of the Sun in the sky can be found by measuring the length of the shadows cast by an object during the day.

Repeat this exercise for the next few days. z Find the duration of the solar day by finding a difference in time on two consecutive days as shown in Table 11.1. So, changing phases of the Moon is a natural periodic event, with a cycle of almost a month, which can also be used for time keeping. Yes, along with the natural periodic events of day and night and the changing seasons about which we learnt earlier. But how are these periodic events used for keeping time?

Is it nearly equal to 24 hours? The phases of the Moon give us another natural cycle with a duration that is longer than a day. The Moon takes about 29.5 days (nearly a month) to cycle through all its phases. The cycle of the phases of the Moon is the basis for a month, another unit to measure time (Fig. 11.8). The next larger unit to measure time is related to the natural cycle of seasons. Do you remember learning earlier that the Earth revolves around the Sun and takes nearly 365 and a quarter days to complete one revolution around the Sun? The Earth undergoes one cycle of seasons during this time, which can be used to define a solar year (Fig. 11.8). 11.2.1 Lunar calendars In ancient times, people had noticed that during one cycle of seasons, one can fit nearly 12 cycles of the phases of the moon, that is, 12 lunar months. This is how lunar calendars came into being, with the day as the shortest unit, a month of nearly 29.5 days, and a lunar year consisting of 12 lunar months. The phases of the Moon thus gave an easy and a perfectly sound way to track the passage of time. However, in a lunar calendar the seasons do not remain synchronised to the same lunar months in successive lunar years. The reason is that the seasons repeat in approximately 365 days while the lunar year is 354 days long.

Cycle of Earth’s seasons due to its revolution around the Sun define a year Cycle of Moon’s phases due to its revolution around the Earth defines a month Cycle of Sun returning to its highest position in the sky due to Earth’s rotation defines a day 180 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 11.2.2 Solar calendars It was important to know the arrival of seasons for agricultural purposes. This need for a year to synchronise with seasons led to the creation of solar calendars. The Gregorian calendar, widely used today, is a solar calendar. The months in solar calendars are adjusted to add up to 365 days. That is why in Gregorian calendars, some months have 30 days, others 31, and February has only 28 days. On top of the 365 days, the Earth takes nearly an extra quarter of a day to complete one revolution around the Sun. These extra hours add up to approximately one day every four years. To adjust for this, solar calendars add an extra day every four years using the concept of a leap year. In the Gregorian calendar, if a year is divisible by four, then an extra leap day is added. So in a leap year, February has 29 days, which keeps the calendar well synchronised with the seasons. A step further The Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to go from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a day every"}

A step further The Earth takes slightly less time than 365 and a quarter day to go from one spring equinox to the next spring equinox. Adding a day every four years helps to synchronise with the seasons, but it actually adds a little too much over time. To fix this, leap years are skipped every 100 years—like in 1700, 1800, and 1900. But skipping all of them would make the calendar lag slightly behind. So every 400 years, a leap year is again added back—like in 1600 and 2000. These careful corrections keep the calendar closely matched with the seasons over long periods of time! A step further As we learnt earlier, seasons are caused by the Earth’s revolution around the Sun and its movement from the spring equinox to winter equinox and back. The time between successive spring equinoxes is called the tropical year. Gregorian calendar is based upon tropical year. We have also learnt earlier that the stars that rise at sunset change throughout the year due to the Earth’s revolution around the Sun. The time duration required for the same stars to rise again at sunset is called the sidereal year, and it can also be used to define a solar calendar. The sidereal year is longer than the tropical year by a mere 20 minutes, and so it takes a long time before the differences between the two calendars become noticeable. In modern times, astronomers use the sidereal year to keep track of the Earth’s position in its orbit around the Sun.

Chapter 11 — Keeping Time with the Skies 181 11.2.3 Luni-solar calendars There is another kind of calendar which primarily uses the Moon’s phases for counting days and months but also make adjustments to stay in sync with the cycle of seasons. The 12 lunar months add up to 354 days and thus fall short by nearly 11 days compared to the solar year. Thus every 2–3 years, Our scientific heritage For thousands of years, people — including those in India — have been observing the sky and developing calendars. People in ancient times did not know that Earth revolves around the Sun, and lacked modern instruments. Yet through years of careful sky observations, they noticed patterns and cycles in natural events. Hence, they could determine that the length of the year was approximately 365 days allowing them to create calendars. For example, careful observation reveals that the Sun does not always rise exactly in the East. In summer, it rises a little northward of East and in winter a little southward of East. These extremes happen on the solstices, around June 21 and December 21 each year.

The year begins on 22 March, which is the day after the spring equinox. Unlike the Gregorian calendar, months in the Indian National Calendar have either 30 or 31 days. The names of these months were taken from traditional Indian calendars. In a regular year, the second to sixth months have 31 days and the rest have 30 days.

Many Indian festivals are tied to the phases of the Moon and hence are based on either lunar or luni-solar calendars. For instance, Diwali falls on the new Moon of the month of Kartika, Holi on the full Moon of Phalguna, Buddha Purnima on the full Moon of Vaisakha, Eid-ul-Fitr is celebrated after sighting the crescent Moon at the end of the month of Ramazan, while Dussehra is celebrated on the tenth day in the month of Ashwina. Hence, they occur on different dates in the Gregorian calendar in successive years. For festivals based on luni-solar calendars, the Gregorian calendar dates can shift, but this shift is typically less than a month. This is because the luni-solar calendars add the intercalary month every few years which correct for the difference between the lunar and the solar year.

Why do most Indian festivals fall on different dates every year? 184 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 A step further A few festivals in India, like Makar Sankranti, Pongal, Bihu, Vaisakhi, Poila Baisakh, and Puthandu, follow a solar sidereal calendar. These festivals happen on almost the same date every year in the Gregorian calendar which is based on the tropical year. A long time ago, these festivals were tied to either a solstice or an equinox. Due to the small difference in the sidereal and tropical years, the dates of these festivals slowly shift away from the solstices/equinoxes. This shift is due to slow wobble of the Earth’s axis, similar to the movement of the axis of a wobbling top. This causes the dates of festivals based on the sidereal calendar to move ahead in tropical calendar. For example, Makar Sankranti moves ahead by one day every 71 years. Ever heard of ...

The Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) has launched many satellites that support these activities. The Cartosat series of satellites, launched by ISRO, capture high-quality images of the Earth to improve maps, plan cities, and handle natural disasters in India. One such mapping platform, Bhuvan, uses these images to show terrain, soil, land use, vegetation, and more. AstroSat, another ISRO mission, makes scientific observations of stars and other celestial objects. India’s other space missions include Chandrayaan 1, 2, and 3 to the Moon; Aditya L1 to study the Sun; and Mangalyaan to Mars.

A step further A lot of artificial satellites are being sent up in space by many countries. After their useful life, many of them and their rocket parts become space junk or space debris. This debris crowds space, and could collide with working satellites. While small debris burns up in the atmosphere when it falls towards the Earth, the larger pieces can crash on ground. Countries are now working together to remove this dangerous debris.

When vegetation is scarce and waterholes dry up in their natural habitat, elephants may wander in to nearby farms or plantations in search of food like bananas and sugarcane. This can lead to in crop damage and at times, even harm people and domestic animals. Changes in rainfall and temperature affect vegetation. Cutting down trees for constructing roads and buildings makes it worse. This leads to the shrinking and drying of forests, the natural home of animals. When forests cannot support wildlife, animals tend to move into human habitats. Elephants are adapted to forest life, but sudden changes make it hard for them to survive. Wildlife ecologists have identified and marked corridors in many parts of the country to allow safe movement of animals. These corridors correct forest habitats, enabling wildlife—such as elephants to travel in need between large forest areas without coming into conflict with human settlements. This chain of events shows how closely nature’s elements are connected. To understand such interconnections, we must study the components of our environment. 12.1 \u0007How Do We Experience and Interpret Our Surroundings? You have learnt in Curiosity, Grade 6 chapter ‘Diversity in the Living World’ that different habitats have different kinds of plants and animals. A habitat is simply place where an organism lives.

In Activities 12.1 and 12.2, you observed that different group of organisms live together in a habitat. A community comprises different populations sharing the same habitat. The biotic components of a habitat, such as the plants, animals, and microorganisms together form the community. These organisms interact and depend on one another for survival. Ever heard of ...

A flower has a stalk, green leafy structures called sepals, coloured petals and two reproductive parts. Carpels (female) and stamens (male). Stamens burst release yellow dust like pollen grains. Wind, ‘water insects, bats and birds helps carry pollen from the stamens to the carpels of the same and different flowers. This process is called pollination (Fig.12.2). It is essential for the formation of fruits and seeds. Fig. 12.2: Insect pollination 12.3 \u0007Does Every Organism in a Community Matter?

Similarly, can overfishing by humans change this balance? How do you think it may affect the living and non-living parts of the habitat? 12.4 \u0007What Are the Different Types of Interactions Among Organisms and their Surroundings? In Curiosity, Grade 7, you learn about how plants and animals need air, water, soil, and sunlight to grow. Living organisms, or the biotic community, depend on non-living things, that is abiotic components for their survival. Plants and animals also depend on each other for nutrition, respiration, and reproduction. These are interactions among the biotic components. Both types of interactions — among biotic components, and between biotic and abiotic components — are important for survival in any habitat.

Table 12.3: Interaction of biotic and abiotic components in a habitat Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony 197 In Activity 12.4, you understood different types of interactions occur within a habitat. From this, you can infer that the biotic components (plants, animals, and microorganisms) and the abiotic components (air, water, soil, sunlight, and temperature) in a habitat interact with each other to form an ecosystem. Organisms in an ecosystem interact with abiotic components for food, shelter, and protection in an ecosystem. Different communities of living organisms interact with abiotic components in an ecosystems. There are two main types of ecosystems in nature. Aquatic ecosystems include ponds, rivers, and lakes while terrestrial ecosystems include forests, farms or even large trees like banyan, mango, or pilkhan. Hence, ecosystems can be large or small. Can you find overlapping ecosystems in Fig. 12.6? Fig. 12.6 shows an overlap of different terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In this figure, you can see a small river (an aquatic ecosystem) along with mountains, forests, grassland, and farmland, which are examples of terrestrial ecosystems. Farmland is a human-made ecosystem. These ecosystems are interacting with each other at any given point. In Activity 12.4, we have seen the importance of the components and their interactions in an ecosystem. For example, sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water are essential for producing food in plants; soil provides medium and essential nutrients for plant growth; air provides oxygen for respiration in plants as well as animals; water is essential for all living organisms.

This shows how living organisms depend on the non-living component of an ecosystem. Just as biotic components depend on abiotic components, abiotic components also depend on biotic components. For example, plants release oxygen during photosynthesis, roots hold soil in place and prevent erosion, and plants retain soil moisture and help cool the atmosphere. You can identify and study any ecosystem in your surroundings and observe different types of interactions among the biotic and abiotic components. While studying biotic interactions, notice how organisms depend on each other for food.

As you know, plants make their own food by the process of photosynthesis. Thus, they are called producers or autotrophs (auto=self + troph=food). Organisms that cannot produce their own food and depend on other organisms for their food are called consumers or heterotrophs (hetero = other + troph = food). List the heterotrophs from Table 12.4. Organisms that eat only plants are called herbivores, such as deer and hare. Those that eat only animals are carnivores, such as leopard. Organisms that eat both plants and animals are omnivores, such as crows, foxes, and mice. 12.5 Who Eats Whom? In Activity 12.5, we learn about the feeding relationship among organisms.

Look at Fig. 12.11, and observe the relationship between different food chains in an ecosystem. Are these food chains interlinked? Each of the organisms may be eaten by two or more types of organisms. Thus, in an ecosystem, the food chains are interlinked with each other to form a network, called a food web. You know that living organisms grow, perform many functions, develop, and die. During their life cycle, organisms produce a lot of waste, including dead matter and food waste. 12.6 What Happens to Waste in Nature? You may have seen small umbrella-like structures, mushrooms, growing on dead plants or trees during the rainy season (Fig. 12.12). These are a type of fungi that grow on dead matter. Microorganisms like fungi and bacteria break down complex substances in dead plants and animals into simpler ones.

Plants grow in soil and many of the nutrients in soil come from the decomposition process. Thus, decomposers play an important role in recycling nutrients. In nature, nothing is wasted — everything is reused. Does nature really waste anything? Ever heard of ... India is a country with diverse habitats and seasons. Many migratory birds fly thousands of miles and reach different habitats in India. They migrate from different parts of the world to avoid harsh climate, and in search for food. Birds not only enhance the aesthetics of those habitats but also play a significant role in keeping the balance in an ecosystem as pollinators or seed dispersers along the path they migrate. This way they link two habitats. These birds are predators of insect pests and help farmers to control pest populations, and indirectly help in healthy crop growth.

It shows how one small change can lead to many others. For example, many plants in a pond start dying because of pollution. With fewer plants less oxygen will be 202 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 produced in water which will lead to a drop in the fish population in that water body. Reduction in fish population will have cascading effects and there will be less number of consumers in the pond. As a result, insects will increase in number. These insects will spread to nearby farmlands. This is how farmers will be compelled to use pesticides to grow their crops which may again adversely affect the environment. Further consequences may emerge in the form of other environmental issues.

Activity 12.9: Let us read In the 1980s, India was a significant exporter of frog legs, especially of the Indian bullfrog (Hoplobatrachus tigerinus) (Fig. 12.14). This large-scale harvesting led to a decline in frog populations. Since frogs eat insects, their reduced numbers resulted in a rise in agricultural pests. This forced farmers to use more synthetic pesticides, which harmed the environment, soil and water quality, and affected the overall environmental and human health. The Government of India banned the export of frog legs to prevent further ecological damage.

Fig. 12.14: Indian bullfrog Fig. 12.15: Competition among a community in an ecosystem 12.8 \u0007How Do Interactions Maintain Balance in Ecosystems? Besides feeding relationships, organisms also compete for common resources like food, water, physical space, or sunlight. This competition helps control population size and keeps the ecosystem balanced. Without it, one species could multiply too much causing an imbalance in the ecosystem (Fig. 12.15). There are other types of relationships too. Based on the example given in Fig. 12.16, what do you observe? Chapter 12 — How Nature Works in Harmony 203 z Mutualism: Both organisms benefit. For example: Honeybees and flowers. z Commensalism: One organism benefits while the other is not affected.

He proved that a healthy prey population is key to predator survival. He inspired many youngsters to study wildlife and protect the forests and biodiversity of India. 12.9 What Are the Benefits of an Ecosystem? We have learnt that biotic components and abiotic components of an ecosystem depend on each other and support various life processes. Humans also benefit from ecosystems. For example, forests provide fresh air, fertile soil, food, fibres, timber, and medicines. Similarly, aquatic ecosystems provide water and food. Ecosystems also offer aesthetic and recreational value. This benefits and supports our well-being and shows how closely nature and humans are connected. However, when we overuse or misuse natural resources, we disturb the balance in nature. Now let us look at a real-life example of a threatened ecosystem — the Sundarbans. 204 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The Sundarbans have the largest mangrove forests in the world. Located where the Ganges and Brahmaputra Rivers meet between India and Bangladesh, the Sundarbans’ forests and rivers are home to various flora and fauna, many of which are endangered. The Sundarbans protect us by slowing down strong winds and waves during storms and floods. The trees also absorb carbon dioxide from the air and release oxygen.

Because of its importance, The United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) declared the Sundarbans a World Heritage Site in 1987. However, the Sundarbans (Fig. 12.17) are under a serious threat. Mangrove trees are being cut for fuelwood and farming. Illegal hunting and overuse of forest resources are a threat to the wildlife living there. Pollution from industrial waste and untreated sewage in rivers are also damaging the water and habitat. These human activities disrupt the natural way ecosystems work. Similarly, other ecosystems across India are also under threat. Problems like deforestation, overuse of natural resources, the spread of invasive species, unsustainable land use, and pollution are damaging forests, rivers, scrublands, wetlands, grasslands, and coastal areas. How can we stop damaging forests, rivers, and wetlands? Think about what actions you and your community can take to protect these important places. Protected areas are parts of land or water set aside to conserve wildlife and their habitats. India has many protected areas like national parks, wildlife sanctuaries, biosphere reserves, and community conserved areas. These places help protect entire habitats including endangered animals, birds, and many rare plants. Famous examples include Jim Corbett National Park (Uttarakhand), Manas National Park (Assam), Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve (Western Ghats), Chilika Lake (Odisha), Eaglenest Wildlife Sanctuary (Arunachal Pradesh), Hemis National Park (Leh), Keibul Lamjao National Park (Manipur), Pirotan Island Marine National Park (Gujarat).

When well designed, these can help reduce pollution, support biodiversity, and provide recreational spaces for people. Unlike natural ecosystems, these need human care and management. Can you name any human made ecosystem in your area? 12.9.2 How do healthy ecosystems serve our farms? Farming, a major livelihood in India, can become unsustainable if not managed well by applying environment friendly farming practices. Humans have been practising farming for thousands of years to grow food. As the population grew, our dependence on agriculture increased. Between 1950 and 1965, India faced a food crisis due to low crop production. In the mid-20th century, the use of tractors, machines, synthetic fertilisers, and pesticides helped increase food production. This period is known as the Green Revolution. However, these farming methods are now considered unsustainable because of the overuse of synthetic chemicals, excessive groundwater extraction, and growing only one type of crop for commercial gain. How do these practices harm both the environment and human health? Many scientists believe that overusing pesticides and growing the same type of crop repeatedly on the same land leads to soil degradation. Understanding ecosystems can help us adopt better and more sustainable farming practices. Activity 12.10: Let us survey Visit a nearby farm with your parents or teacher/interact with farmers in your community to find out about the farming practices they adopt. z Prepare a list of questions for farmers to find out the pesticides and other farm inputs they use, and whether they reuse or recycle materials to improve their crops."}

And why? { What effects do you notice when using synthetic fertilisers and pesticides? { Have you seen any changes in soil health after using these synthetic fertilisers and pesticides? z Interact with farmers based on these questions. Based on your findings, prepare a report. 206 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 What inference do you draw from your interactions with farmers? Synthetic fertilisers and pesticides have played a vital role in improving crop production and helped countries like India become food secure. However, their long-term use can affect the environment and soil health. Overuse of synthetic fertilisers may reduce soil fertility by decreasing friendly microorganisms in soil and lowering organic matter (humus), which helps bind soil particles. Without enough humus, soil becomes prone to erosion. Also, it reduces the population of natural predators which ultimately increase the population of pests (Fig. 12.18). Heavy irrigation and repeated ploughing can also disturb soil organisms like earthworms and snails, which are important for maintaining ecological balance. Some pests may develop resistance to pesticides, making them difficult to control. Growing the same crop repeatedly, known as monoculture, can reduce crop diversity and affect pollinators, which are crucial for food production. To make farming more sustainable, some farmers are exploring organic and natural farming methods. These aim to reduce the use of synthetic fertilisers and support sustainable farming, with minimal interference in natural ecosystems. Based on your learning,"}

Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 211 We have now reached the final chapter of this book, the concluding chapter in our scientific journey through the middle stage. It is time to put together all that we have seen and learnt and try to understand why our home, planet Earth, is like no other place in the known universe. As you have learnt in Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, the Earth is a planet orbiting the Sun. However, it is not just any planet. It is a planet that sustains life — full of diverse landscapes, from towering mountains and vast oceans to endless deserts and lush forests. Today, our satellites allow us to take amazing pictures of our planet. The image in the beginning page was taken by an Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) Earth Observation Satellite and made by combining nearly 3000 smaller images, like pieces of a mosaic. Although it looks beautiful, it’s a false colour image, where scientists use different colours to show different types of information. These satellite images help us study plants on land and tiny organisms in the ocean, and can even detect things like ocean temperature, oil spills, and wind direction. In this chapter, we will uncover the unique conditions that make Earth the perfect home for living beings. 13.1 Why Is Earth a Unique Planet?"}

While there are perhaps billions of planets in the universe, Earth is the only one where life, as we know today, exists and thrives in all its forms. Have you ever wondered where all life on Earth actually exists? All the mountains, rivers, forests, animals, and people are found on just a very thin layer on the surface of our planet. From the tallest mountain to the deepest ocean trench, the crust, where all of life exists, is tiny compared to the size of Earth. If Earth were the size of an apple, the crust would be as thin as the apple’s skin as shown in Fig. 13.1. This delicate, life supporting layer is what makes Earth truly special. crust Fig. 13.1: The Earth’s crust is like the thin skin of an apple Crust Upper mantle Lower mantle Outer core Inner core 212 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Let us conduct an activity to list out some features of the Earth that you think make it special.

Table 13.1: Interesting features about the Earth Discuss the features you have listed with your teacher and friends. You may realise that the Earth is interesting and important to us in many ways. It provides us with the air that we breathe, the water that we drink, and the soil that helps in growing crops. The Earth also provides us materials like rock and timber with which we build our homes, buildings, and roads. You must be curious to know what makes the Earth a unique planet which not only allows life like us to exist but also sustains it. 13.2 \u0007What Do the Planets of Our Solar System Look Like? In Curiosity, Grade 6, you had studied the solar system in the chapter ‘Beyond Earth’. Let us recall some of the things we had learnt. Our solar system has eight planets that go around the Sun in nearly circular orbits. In order of their increasing distance from the Sun, they are Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, I wonder what makes the Earth unique for living beings to grow and survive!

Thus, when a planet is close to the Sun, it would be very hot. As we move away from the Sun, planets should get colder. Is this what you found in Table 13.2? This is generally correct, except that Venus, the second planet from the Sun has the highest average temperature and is the hottest planet. Why is this so? Venus is the hottest planet not because it is the closest to the Sun, but because its thick atmosphere traps heat. 214 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 The air on Venus is almost entirely made up of carbon dioxide gas, which does not let the heat escape. This is called"}

This is called the greenhouse effect (Fig. 13.2), and it makes Venus even hotter than Mercury, which is relatively closer to the Sun. On the Earth also, gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, after it gets warmed by the Sun. Thus, greenhouse effect plays an important role in maintaining just the right temperature on Earth. A step further The greenhouse effect that causes a planet like Venus and Earth to trap heat does not work the same way as a greenhouse for growing plants in a cool climate. On Venus or Earth, gases like carbon dioxide in the atmosphere trap heat by absorbing the radiation given off by the Earth, after it gets warmed by the Sun. A plant greenhouse, on the other hand, traps warmed air simply because it is a closed space, usually with glass walls (Fig. 13.3). It heats up during the day, but the air stays in and the heat does not escape easily. So while both keep things warm, they do it differently!

If the Earth were closer to the Sun, it would be too hot and all the water would evaporate; if it were farther away, it would be too cold, and all the water would freeze. In such extreme conditions, it would have been impossible for most life forms — especially plants, animals, and humans — to grow and thrive on Earth. Although some microbes, like certain Fig. 13.4: The habitable zone around a star Habitable zone Too hot Just right Too cold Fig. 13.2: Schematic of greenhouse effect on Earth Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 215 bacteria, can survive in frozen environments, from what we know so far, liquid water is essential for life to evolve. Earth’s distance from the Sun allows water to remain mostly in liquid form, which is essential for the development and sustenance of life in all its form. The range of distances from the Sun (or another star) over which water remains liquid is called the habitable zone, or sometimes also called the ‘Goldilocks zone’ (Fig. 13.4). As you have also studied in Social Science, most of Earth’s surface is covered with water. Thus, when seen from space, the Earth looks blue because of the vast amount of water—hence the name Blue Planet (Fig. 13.5). Did Mars ever support life? Mars lies at the edge of the Sun’s habitable zone. Several spacecrafts have been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, but no proof of life has been found yet.

Several spacecrafts have been sent to Mars, rovers have landed and explored its surface, but no proof of life has been found yet. However, scientists think that in the past, Mars may have had liquid water — maybe even some lakes — and conditions that could support simple life forms (Fig. 13.6). This is one reason Mars continues to interest scientists. It also reminds us that science doesn’t always have final answers. As we explore more, we may find new clues—or even new kinds of life. Science stays open to change when we learn more. Fig. 13.6: Mars A step further Is the temperature or distance from the Sun, the only factor that makes the Earth habitable? What would happen if the size of the Earth were too small or too big? Fig. 13.5: Earth — The blue planet 13.3.2 Size of the Earth There are some other important factors that make the Earth habitable. In our solar system, the orbits of most planets, including the Earth are almost circular. This keeps the amount of 216 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 sunlight and heat nearly steady throughout the year, preventing extreme summers and winters at most places. However, moderate temperature due to the right distance from the Sun isn’t the only factor that makes the Earth habitable. The planet is also the right size to support an atmosphere. As you learnt earlier, the atmosphere is the layer of gases that surrounds the Earth, and it plays a major role in sustaining life. You also learnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth’s gravity pulls objects towards it. If Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), its gravity would have been too weak"}

You also learnt in Chapter 5 that the Earth’s gravity pulls objects towards it. If Earth were much smaller (but with the same average density), its gravity would have been too weak to hold on to the gases in our atmosphere, and they would have escaped into space. On Mars, the atmosphere is 100 times thinner than on Earth, and Mercury has no atmosphere at all. On the other hand, if the planet was too large, and gravity was much stronger, it would perhaps pull us down to the planet with such a large force that our bones could get crushed! Due to the right size of the Earth, it is able to support atmosphere which is essential for life. The presence of oxygen in the Earth’s atmosphere allows us to breathe, and is needed by almost all forms of life on Earth. But oxygen has another important role. Some of the oxygen in our atmosphere, gets converted to another form called ozone (a three-atom oxygen molecule), and forms an important part of the atmosphere called the ozone layer. This layer acts like a shield, blocking harmful ultraviolet (UV) rays from the Sun that can damage living cells. Our scientific heritage India’s Mangalyaan (Mars Orbiter Mission), launched in 2013 by Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO), was a big step in exploring Mars (Fig. 13.7). It carried tools to study the planet’s atmosphere, surface, and signs of past water. Some of these sensors help scientists ask big questions — like was Mars ever suitable for life? Mangalyaan showed the world that India could do space science with smart, low-cost technology — and it helped bring Mars closer to all of us. Fig. 13.7:"}

Fig. 13.7: Mangalyaan Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 217 13.3.3 Magnetic field of the Earth In Curiosity, Grade 6, we learnt that a freely suspended magnet always settles in a fixed direction. This is because the Earth itself behaves like a giant magnet. You have also seen in Chapter 4 that the region around a magnet where its effect is felt has a magnetic field. It is believed that the movement of molten iron in Earth’s core may be the origin for Earth’s magnetic field. Earth is constantly hit by tiny, high-energy particles that come from space. Some come from far across the universe and are called cosmic rays. Other particles come from the Sun and are called the solar wind. These particles can be harmful as they can damage the atmosphere, reduce the ozone layer, and let in more harmful UV rays, which can affect life on Earth. Thankfully, the Earth’s magnetic field acts like a protective shield. It pushes many of these harmful particles away from the Earth, keeping our atmosphere, and hence life on our planet safe. Earth’s unique position in the solar system — allows the presence of liquid water — along with its size, atmosphere, and magnetic field, all help make it a planet where life can emerge and thrive. But, how is life supported and sustained on Earth? Does the magnetic field of the Earth have any role in sustaining life on Earth? 13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained"}

But, how is life supported and sustained on Earth? Does the magnetic field of the Earth have any role in sustaining life on Earth? 13.4 What Allows Life to Be Sustained on Earth? Earth has the right conditions for life, but it is the beautiful connections between living and non-living things that help life to thrive. In Curiosity, Grades 6 and 7, you learnt about key natural resources, such as, air, water, sunlight, soil, and minerals. You also learnt about the important life processes in plants and animals. Now, let us explore how all these elements interact to support and sustain life on Earth. 13.4.1 Air, water, and sunlight We know that the atmosphere contains oxygen, which humans, animals, and plants use for respiration. In the presence of sunlight, plants take carbon dioxide from the air and water from 218 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 the soil to prepare food by photosynthesis. In the process, oxygen is released, which is needed for respiration. We have learnt, radiation from the Sun heats the Earth. Some of this heat is trapped by the atmosphere due to the greenhouse effect. This effect though mild, keeps the temperature just high enough for water to remain in the liquid state. In Curiosity, Grade 7, you also learnt about heat transfer by radiation. Without an atmosphere, the Earth would lose heat to space and become too cold. So the greenhouse effect helps keep the Earth warm. Water is essential for life. You have learnt that it covers about 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and is found in ponds, lakes, rivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater. All this water forms the hydrosphere. In"}

You have learnt that it covers about 70 per cent of the Earth’s surface and is found in ponds, lakes, rivers, springs, seas, oceans, and groundwater. All this water forms the hydrosphere. In Chapter 7, you learnt that water is a good solvent. In Curiosity, Grade 7, we learnt how water transports nutrients from soil to leaves in plants. In animals, it regulates body temperature, aids digestion, and ensures hydration, all essential for health and life. Though much of Earth is covered by water, we still know little about what lives deep in the oceans. The hydrosphere is home to millions of life forms, from tiny planktons to giant whales, many still being discovered. Oceans, lakes, and rivers provide rich environments for aquatic life (Fig. 13.8). Freshwater is also needed to grow crops and support people around the world. Water vapour in the air forms clouds and brings rain or snow. This refills rivers, lakes, and underground water. Rainfall affects the kinds of plants and animals that can live in a place. Moving air also shapes weather and rainfall — which influence farming, water supply, and life on land. 13.4.2 Soil, rocks, and minerals Beneath our feet lies something remarkable — the Earth’s crust, made of rocks, soil, and minerals. It may seem hard and lifeless, but it provides almost everything life needs to grow and survive. From soil that helps plants grow to minerals that give us salt, coal, oil, and metals like iron and copper — this outer layer support both ecosystems and human life. The solid parts of the Earth, including materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as the geosphere. Soil may look like simple dirt, but it"}

The solid parts of the Earth, including materials like rocks, soils, and minerals are known as the geosphere. Soil may look like simple dirt, but it is rich in nutrients like nitrogen and potassium that plants need to grow. These nutrients come from the slow breakdown of rocks and the remains of plants and animals. Fig. 13.8: Life in water Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 219 There are various types of landforms, rocks, soils, etc., on Earth. This variety along with the processes that shape and alter them is called geodiversity (Fig. 13.9). It helps create unique habitats where different types of life can thrive. The non-living parts of nature, like soil, rocks, and water, aren’t just a background — they help shape the story of life itself. 13.4.3 Plants, animals, and microorganisms From the chapter on microbes to the chapter on ecology, we have seen that the Earth is full of life — from trees, shrubs, herbs, to animals, insects, and tiny organisms invisible to the naked eye. All living beings, along with the places where they live, make up the biosphere. This includes land, water, and air, where life interacts with its surroundings to survive and grow. As you learnt in Chapter 12, living beings depend on one another and their environment. Plants make food through photosynthesis, animals eat plants or other animals, and decomposers break down dead matter and return nutrients to the soil. Nature works together as a system to support life. 13.4.4 The importance of balance Have you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in balance? Earth is like a giant teamwork"}

Nature works together as a system to support life. 13.4.4 The importance of balance Have you ever wondered how so many things on Earth stay in balance? Earth is like a giant teamwork project between nature, weather, and life itself. It is a vast, living system where land, air, water, and living things support and affect one another. Even a small change in one part — like cutting down a forest — can impact rainfall, soil, air quality, and the animals that live there. Life on Earth survives not because of just one thing, but because everything works together in balance. It is this balance that keeps our planet habitable. That’s why preserving and protecting clean air, water, soil, and all forms of life isn’t just important but essential for keeping Earth healthy for the future. 13.5 What Keeps Life from Disappearing? If plants and animals didn’t reproduce, life would eventually disappear from Earth. Reproduction ensures that each type of organism continues to exist, maintaining the continuity of life. We usually expect that animals will produce young ones that resemble them — cows have calves, and cats have kittens. This happens because parents pass on instructions to their offspring about how to develop from a single cell. These instructions, Fig. 13.9: Geodiversity 220 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 called genetic material or genes, are stored inside every cell of a living being. You can think of genes as a detailed instruction manual inside each cell. Some instructions tell the cell how to make blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, or skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into a cow, or a kitten grows into"}

Some instructions tell the cell how to make blood, while others guide the formation of bones, muscles, or skin. Together, these instructions ensure that a calf grows into a cow, or a kitten grows into a cat. But reproduction does more than just create more of the same kind of living beings. It also allows for small changes in the instructions that are passed down from parents to offpsrings. Sometimes, these changes help a plant or animal survive better in a new environment. For example, over time, camels developed humps to store fat and survive in deserts. Even microbes evolve — some bacteria, as you learnt in the chapter on health, have become resistant to antibiotics, helping them persist. Over many generations, such changes can lead to new features — or even completely new types of living beings. So, reproduction not only keeps each kind continuing, but also helps life adapt change, and continue in new forms (Fig. 13.10). But how can the same process lead both to similarity (an animal gives birth to similar individual, such as a cow gives birth to a cow) and variation (shows different characteristics like difference in color and height of to individuals of some kind)? That is a fascinating puzzle. There are two types of reproductive processes — one in which the young are almost exactly like their parent and another in which they look slightly different from their parents. In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces new individuals that are exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside the cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents combine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of the parent. They share some traits"}

In asexual reproduction, a single parent produces new individuals that are exact copies of itself (exact in terms of the instructions inside the cell). In sexual reproduction, instructions from two parents combine to create offspring that are not exactly like either of the parent. They share some traits with both parents, but also have differences. This mixing helps keep useful features while allowing new ones to appear. Over many generations, these small differences can add up — leading to big differences, and even new life forms. Let’s explore how reproduction takes place in plants and animals, and how it helps living beings develop special features and sometimes change over time. 13.5.1 Asexual reproduction Many plants can reproduces when any part of the plants — leaf, stem, or root — is planted in soil. This kind of reproduction is called vegetative propagation. Fig. 13.10: Development of calf to cow Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 221 Can you observe and list some plants around you that grow this way?

This is easy to observe in animals, but did you know even flowering plants have male and female parts? Some microorganisms like bacteria and yeast also have two ‘mating types’ that act like the two parents.

Fig. 13.11: Vegetative propagation — (a) Ginger; (b) Potato (b) (a) 222 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Babies do not look exactly like their mother or father. Even brothers and sisters in the same family can look different from each other. This is because every baby gets a mix of genetic information from both parents through gametes. Each gamete carries a different set of instructions for things like eye colour, hair type, and more. These instructions mix in different ways when the sperm and eggs joins to form a baby. These instructions mix in different ways each time, so each child is unique. No wonder one child may ‘inherit’ a nose similar to mother and another may inherit eyes similar to father. It all depends on which pieces of the parent’s ‘instruction book set’ came together. Sexual reproduction in plants Plants use different parts of their flowers to produce male and female gametes. Pollen grains found inside the anther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, found deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. Pollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or animals — this process is called pollination. When the male and female"}

Pollen grains found inside the anther of a flower are the male gametes, while ovules, found deep inside the flower, are the female gametes. Pollen is carried to another flower by wind, insects, or animals — this process is called pollination. When the male and female gametes combine, it is called fertilisation, forming a zygote that becomes the seed. The fleshy part of the flower around the ovule develops into a fruit (Fig. 13.13). When birds or animals eat the fruit, the seeds often get dropped far from the original plant — a helpful way for plants to spread. That’s how a banyan seed, dropped by a bird that ate a fruit and excreted the seed, might sprout in a crack in a wall after the rains. When seeds get water, they use stored nutrients to grow roots and shoots. Remember in Grade 6 you had studied the germination of seeds where you observed tiny shoots and the first leaves appear. Sexual reproduction in animals In animals, gametes are called sperm (male) and eggs (female). Fertilisation may take place in water, for example, male and female fish or frogs eject sperm and eggs, respectively, into the water where they combine to form the zygote. In these animals, the development of the zygote into an embryo also takes place in water (Fig. 13.14). In birds and mammals, including humans, sperm are deposited inside the female and fertilisation takes place when the sperm swim towards the egg produced by the female. After this step, birds and mammals follow different processes.

The development of the zygote into an embryo happens after the egg is laid during the hatching process. Think about how much ‘food’ the female parent has to put into each egg — it has to last for the developing embryo until it hatches. This is one strategy to ensures supply of nutrition to the embryo. In most mammals, the development of the zygote into an embryo takes place inside the body of the female. The mother’s body provides all the food and oxygen the baby needs to grow until it is born. This is a different way of giving nutrition to the developing baby, compared to animals like birds that lay eggs. What are the advantages and disadvantages of giving birth to young ones vs. laying eggs? Do you think animals like dogs, cows, or humans could lay eggs like birds? Why or why not? 13.6 What Are the Threats to Life on Earth? We know that life on Earth depends on a delicate balance of living and non-living things working together. But human actions are disturbing this balance. Even small changes in global temperature, oxygen levels, or the ozone layer can put life at risk. Today, the biggest environmental challenges that we face are climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution — together known as the triple planetary crisis.

Burning fossil fuels like coal and oil releases greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. These trap even more heat in the atmosphere which causes global warming. Normally, Earth keeps a balance since trees, plants, and even tiny ocean planktons absorb carbon dioxide as they grow. But when we burn fossil fuels, we release extra carbon that has been locked underground for millions of years. The Earth cannot absorb this fast enough, so the heat builds up. Even a small increase in temperature can melt ice caps, raise sea levels which could flood many coastal cities, cause extreme weather conditions, and lead to many plants and animals disappearing. These long-term changes in temperature, rainfall, and weather patterns are called climate change. When natural habitats are destroyed, plants and animals may disappear, upsetting ecosystems. For example, as we saw in Chapter 12, if grasses vanish, animals that feed on them like deer or grasshoppers struggle to survive. And without herbivores, predators like tigers or foxes lose their food too. Every type of living thing has a role, and losing even a few weakens nature’s ability to support life. 224 Curiosity — Textbook of Science for Grade 8 Pollution adds to the problem. Air pollution from factories, vehicles, and burning fuels harms both people and the nature. It can cause breathing problems, damage crops, and lead to smog and acid rain (Fig. 13.15). Climate change affects everything—from crop growth and water supply to wildlife habitats and human health. To protect life on Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner energy, and make wiser choices. We have also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within a delicate balance supported by"}

To protect life on Earth, we need to cut pollution, use cleaner energy, and make wiser choices. We have also learnt that life on Earth flourishes within a delicate balance supported by interdependent natural systems. However, this balance is increasingly threatened by human actions. For example, a little less or more of oxygen in air, or a little lower or higher temperature of the Earth, or a little less of ozone in the atmosphere, could endanger life on the Earth. Countries around the world have made global agreements to protect the environment. The Montreal Protocol (1987) helped reduce harmful chemicals like Chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs), allowing the ozone layer to slowly recover. The Earth Summit (1992) led to international efforts on climate change and biodiversity. Later, the Kyoto Protocol (2005) and Paris Agreement (2015) committed countries to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. The Paris Agreement set a goal to limit global warming to below 1.5 °C, but as of 2025, the world is not on track to meet that goal. Much more action is needed to avoid any more adverse effects of climate change. Ever heard of ... Water and soil pollution are serious threats to life (Fig. 13.16). Factory, farm and plastic waste harm aquatic life and make water unsafe. Excess fertilisers and poor waste disposal pollute soil, reduce crop yield, and spread harmful substances through the food chain. Protecting them requires better waste management and sustainable farming practices.

At the same time, preserving Fig. 13.16: Water pollution Fig. 13.15: Air pollution Chapter 13 — Our Home: Earth, a Unique Life Sustaining Planet 225 biodiversity is key as diverse ecosystems are stronger and more balanced. Local communities can play a big role in using natural resources sustainably. Everyone can help. Reusing, repairing, and recycling items like clothes and plastic reduce pollution and waste. Small actions like saving energy and water add up. Learning more, sharing ideas, and encouraging others also makes a difference. In conclusion, sustaining life on Earth needs action from all of us — from local communities to global leaders. By working together and living responsibly, we can protect this unique planet and its future. Snapshots  Our Earth is a unique planet in the solar system as it supports life.  Earth orbits the Sun at a distance where the temperature is neither too hot nor too cold, which allows water to exist in liquid form.
